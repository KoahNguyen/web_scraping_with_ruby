Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship|Robert C. Martin|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41TINACY3hL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.<br> <br>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <i> <b>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</b> </i>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.<br> <br>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.<br> <br> <i> <b>Clean Code</b> </i> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.<br> <br>Readers will come away from this book understanding<br> <ul> <li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code</li> <li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</li> <li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</li> <li>How to format code for maximum readability</li> <li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</li> <li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li> </ul>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.<br> <br></div>

Head First Java, 2nd Edition|Kathy Sierra|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gsycdh-TL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java.  You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.<br><br> The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.<br><br> And that's how your brain will learn Java. <em>Head First Java</em> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.  You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI.  And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.  Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required.  So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.<br><br> If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br><br> By exploiting how your brain works, <em>Head First Java</em> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information.  Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.</p></div>

Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python: With Application to Understanding Data (MIT Press)|John V. Guttag (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z7KODWbjL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>This book introduces students with little or no prior programming experience to the art of computational problem solving using Python and various Python libraries, including PyLab. It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters.</p><p>Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. This edition offers expanded material on statistics and machine learning and new chapters on Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.</p></div>

JavaScript: The Good Parts|Douglas Crockford|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5131OWtQRaL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <div><p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p><p>Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.</p><p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p><ul><li>Syntax</li><li>Objects</li><li>Functions</li><li>Inheritance</li><li>Arrays</li><li>Regular expressions</li><li>Methods</li><li>Style</li><li>Beautiful features</li></ul><p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.</p><p>With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.</p></div></div>
