Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship|Robert C. Martin|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41TINACY3hL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.<br> <br>Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with <i> <b>Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship</b> </i>. Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it.<br> <br>What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.<br> <br> <i> <b>Clean Code</b> </i> is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.<br> <br>Readers will come away from this book understanding<br> <ul> <li>How to tell the difference between good and bad code</li> <li>How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code</li> <li>How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes</li> <li>How to format code for maximum readability</li> <li>How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic</li> <li>How to unit test and practice test-driven development</li> </ul>This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.<br> <br></div>

Head First Java, 2nd Edition|Kathy Sierra|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Gsycdh-TL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>Learning a complex new language is no easy task especially when it s an object-oriented computer programming language like Java.  You might think the problem is your brain. It seems to have a mind of its own, a mind that doesn't always want to take in the dry, technical stuff you're forced to study.<br><br> The fact is your brain craves novelty. It's constantly searching, scanning, waiting for something unusual to happen. After all, that's the way it was built to help you stay alive. It takes all the routine, ordinary, dull stuff and filters it to the background so it won't interfere with your brain's real work--recording things that matter. How does your brain know what matters? It's like the creators of the Head First approach say, suppose you're out for a hike and a tiger jumps in front of you, what happens in your brain? Neurons fire. Emotions crank up. Chemicals surge. That's how your brain knows.<br><br> And that's how your brain will learn Java. <em>Head First Java</em> combines puzzles, strong visuals, mysteries, and soul-searching interviews with famous Java objects to engage you in many different ways. It's fast, it's fun, and it's effective. And, despite its playful appearance, Head First Java is serious stuff: a complete introduction to object-oriented programming and Java.  You'll learn everything from the fundamentals to advanced topics, including threads, network sockets, and distributed programming with RMI.  And the new. second edition focuses on Java 5.0, the latest version of the Java language and development platform.  Because Java 5.0 is a major update to the platform, with deep, code-level changes, even more careful study and implementation is required.  So learning the Head First way is more important than ever.<br><br> If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. If you haven't, you're in for a treat. You'll see why people say it's unlike any other Java book you've ever read.<br><br> By exploiting how your brain works, <em>Head First Java</em> compresses the time it takes to learn and retain--complex information.  Its unique approach not only shows you what you need to know about Java syntax, it teaches you to think like a Java programmer. If you want to be bored, buy some other book. But if you want to understand Java, this book's for you.</p></div>

It shows how to write clear and idiomatic Go to solve real-world problems. The book does not assume prior knowledge of Go nor experience with any specific language, so you’ll find it accessible whether you’re most comfortable with JavaScript, Ruby, Python, Java, or C++.</p>  <ul>  <li>  <div style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The first chapter is a tutorial on the basic concepts of Go, introduced through programs for file I/O and text processing, simple graphics, and web clients and servers.</div> </li>  <li>  <div style=""MARGIN: 0px"">Early chapters cover the structural elements of Go programs: syntax, control flow, data types, and the organization of a program into packages, files, and functions. The examples illustrate many packages from the standard library and show how to create new ones of your own. Later chapters explain the package mechanism in more detail, and how to build, test, and maintain projects using the go tool.</div> </li>  <li>  <div style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The chapters on methods and interfaces introduce Go’s unconventional approach to object-oriented programming, in which methods can be declared on any type and interfaces are implicitly satisfied. They explain the key principles of encapsulation, composition, and substitutability using realistic examples.</div> </li>  <li>  <div style=""MARGIN: 0px"">Two chapters on concurrency present in-depth approaches to this increasingly important topic. The first, which covers the basic mechanisms of goroutines and channels, illustrates the style known as communicating sequential processes for which Go is renowned. The second covers more traditional aspects of concurrency with shared variables. These chapters provide a solid foundation for programmers encountering concurrency for the first time.</div> </li>  <li>  <div style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The final two chapters explore lower-level features of Go. One covers the art of metaprogramming using reflection. The other shows how to use the unsafe package to step outside the type system for special situations, and how to use the cgo tool to create Go bindings for C libraries.</div> </li> </ul>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of well-written Go code that cover the whole language, its most important packages, and a wide range of applications. Each chapter has exercises to test your understanding and explore extensions and alternatives.

It provides students with skills that will enable them to make productive use of computational techniques, including some of the tools and techniques of data science for using computation to model and interpret data. The book is based on an MIT course (which became the most popular course offered through MIT's OpenCourseWare) and was developed for use not only in a conventional classroom but in in a massive open online course (MOOC). This new edition has been updated for Python 3, reorganized to make it easier to use for courses that cover only a subset of the material, and offers additional material including five new chapters.</p><p>Students are introduced to Python and the basics of programming in the context of such computational concepts and techniques as exhaustive enumeration, bisection search, and efficient approximation algorithms. Although it covers such traditional topics as computational complexity and simple algorithms, the book focuses on a wide range of topics not found in most introductory texts, including information visualization, simulations to model randomness, computational techniques to understand data, and statistical techniques that inform (and misinform) as well as two related but relatively advanced topics: optimization problems and dynamic programming. This edition offers expanded material on statistics and machine learning and new chapters on Frequentist and Bayesian statistics.</p></div>

JavaScript: The Good Parts|Douglas Crockford|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5131OWtQRaL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <div><p>Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code.</p><p>Considered <em>the</em> JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.</p><p>When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:</p><ul><li>Syntax</li><li>Objects</li><li>Functions</li><li>Inheritance</li><li>Arrays</li><li>Regular expressions</li><li>Methods</li><li>Style</li><li>Beautiful features</li></ul><p>The real beauty? As you move ahead with the subset of JavaScript that this book presents, you'll also sidestep the need to <em>unlearn</em> all the bad parts. Of course, if you want to find out more about the bad parts and how to use them badly, simply consult any other JavaScript book.</p><p>With <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em>, you'll discover a beautiful, elegant, lightweight and highly expressive language that lets you create effective code, whether you're managing object libraries or just trying to get Ajax to run fast. If you develop sites or applications for the Web, this book is an absolute must.</p></div></div>

However, Python has unique strengths, charms, and expressivity that can be hard to grasp at first -- as well as hidden pitfalls that can easily trip you up if you aren't aware of them. <b>Effective Python</b> will help you harness the full power of Python to write exceptionally robust, efficient, maintainable, and well-performing code. Utilizing the concise, scenario-driven style pioneered in Scott Meyers's best-selling <i>Effective C++</i>, Brett Slatkin brings together 59 Python best practices, tips, shortcuts, and realistic code examples from expert programmers.<br>   <br>Through realistic examples, Slatkin uncovers little-known Python quirks, intricacies, and idioms that powerfully impact code behavior and performance. You'll learn how to choose the most efficient and effective way to accomplish key tasks when multiple options exist, and how to write code that's easier to understand, maintain, and improve.<br>   <br>Drawing on his deep understanding of Python's capabilities, Slatkin offers practical advice for each major area of development with both Python 3.x and Python 2.x. Coverage includes:<br>  <ul>  <li>Algorithms</li>  <li>Objects</li>  <li>Concurrency</li>  <li>Collaboration</li>  <li>Built-in modules</li>  <li>Production techniques</li>  <li>And more</li> </ul>  Each section contains specific, actionable guidelines organized into items, each with carefully worded advice supported by detailed technical arguments and illuminating examples. Using <b>Effective Python</b>, you can systematically improve all the Python code you write: not by blindly following rules or mimicking incomprehensible idioms, but by gaining a deep understanding of the technical reasons why they make sense.</div>

Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture|Martin Fowler|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IuDvAU1CL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The practice of enterprise application development has benefited from the emergence of many new enabling technologies. Multi-tiered object-oriented platforms, such as Java and .NET, have become commonplace. These new tools and technologies are capable of building powerful applications, but they are not easily implemented. Common failures in enterprise applications often occur because their developers do not understand the architectural lessons that experienced object developers have learned.</p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px""> </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px""> <b> <i>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</i> </b> is written in direct response to the stiff challenges that face enterprise application developers. The author, noted object-oriented designer Martin Fowler, noticed that despite changes in technology--from Smalltalk to CORBA to Java to .NET--the same basic design ideas can be adapted and applied to solve common problems. With the help of an expert group of contributors, Martin distills over forty recurring solutions into patterns. The result is an indispensable handbook of solutions that are applicable to any enterprise application platform. </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px""> </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">This book is actually two books in one. The first section is a short tutorial on developing enterprise applications, which you can read from start to finish to understand the scope of the book's lessons. The next section, the bulk of the book, is a detailed reference to the patterns themselves. Each pattern provides usage and implementation information, as well as detailed code examples in Java or C#. The entire book is also richly illustrated with UML diagrams to further explain the concepts. </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">Armed with this book, you will have the knowledge necessary to make important architectural decisions about building an enterprise application and the proven patterns for use when building them. </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px""> </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">The topics covered include </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  Dividing an enterprise application into layers </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  The major approaches to organizing business logic </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  An in-depth treatment of mapping between objects and relational databases </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  Using Model-View-Controller to organize a Web presentation </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  Handling concurrency for data that spans multiple transactions </p>  <p style=""MARGIN: 0px"">·  Designing distributed object interfaces</p></div>"
Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - 2nd Edition (MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science)|Harold Abelson|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51H17R%2BbW8L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p> <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> has had a dramatic impact on computer science curricula over the past decade. This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text. There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published. A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises. In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.</p></div>

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.""<br>--Martin Buchholz<br>JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems</p> <p>""For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore's Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl's Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <i> <b>Java Concurrency in Practice</b> </i> provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today's--and tomorrow's--systems.""<br>--Doron Rajwan<br>Research Scientist, Intel Corp</p> <p>""This is the book you need if you're writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you've ever had to synchronize a method and you weren't sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.""<br>--Ted Neward<br>Author of <i>Effective Enterprise Java</i> </p> <p>""Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.""<br>--Kirk Pepperdine<br>CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com</p> <p>""This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore's Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.""<br>--Dr. Cliff Click<br>Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems</p> <p>""I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian's book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach.

I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java's concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.""<br>--Bill Venners<br>Author of <i>Inside the Java Virtual Machine</i> </p> <p>Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In <i> <b>Java Concurrency in Practice</b> </i>, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them.</p> <p>However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. <b> <i>Java Concurrency in Practice</i> </b> arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant.</p> <p>This book covers:</p>    <ul> <li> Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety </li> <li>Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes </li> <li>Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent </li> <li>Performance optimization dos and don'ts </li> <li>Testing concurrent programs </li> <li>Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model</li> </ul>  <br> <br></div>"

SQL QuickStart Guide: The Simplified Beginner's Guide to SQL|ClydeBank Technology (Author),||"<div> <p>The ultimate beginner's guide to learning SQL - from retrieving data to creating databases! </p><p>Structured query language, or SQL (pronounced ""sequel"" by many), is the most widely used programming language in database management and is the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS). SQL programming allows users to return, analyze, create, manage, and delete data within a database - all within a few commands. </p><p>With more industries and organizations looking to the power of data, the need for an efficient, scalable solution for data management is required. More often than not, organizations implement a relational database management system in one form or another. These systems create long-term data ""warehouses"" that can be easily accessed to return and analyze results, such as, ""Show me all of the clients from Canada that have purchased more than $20,000 in the last three years."" This ""query"", which would have taken an extensive amount of hands-on research to complete prior to the use of a database, can now be determined in seconds by executing a simple ""SELECT SQL"" statement on a database. </p><p>SQL can seem daunting to those with little to zero programming knowledge and can even pose a challenge to those who have experience with other languages. Most resources jump right into the technical jargon and are not suited for someone to really grasp how SQL actually works. That's why we created this book. Our goal here is simple: to show you exactly everything you need to know to utilize SQL in whatever capacity you may need in simple, easy-to-follow concepts. Our book provides multiple step-by-step examples of how to master these SQL concepts to ensure you know what you're doing and why you're doing it every step of the way. </p></div>"

This book is going to go more in depth than the previous beginner’s book did in showing you how you can use Python to its fullest advantage.     In the beginner’s book, you learned some of the basic functions of Python and the various pieces of code that you are going to be able to input into Python so that you can make that function work properly. However, in this book, you are going to learn about other functions and pieces of the code that will work with the functions that you already know.   It is here that you are going to be taking another step towards being able to program your own applications, websites, and anything else that you could possibly want to program all with simple blocks of code that you learned from a beginner’s book.   Do not rush into thinking that you are going to be able to write your own computer application just yet. That is going to require that you get through this book and the next one to get a complete understanding of how Python works.     The intermediate level is going to be a level that you may think does not need to be explored because some of it may end up being completely irrelevant to what it is that you are going to do with Python. However, you never know what you are going to find in this book that may just make or break the code that you are completing. So, please do not skip over this book thinking that you are not going to learn something new because I assure you, there is always something new for you to learn even if it is something simple.         <h2>Here’s What You’ll Learn From This Python For Intermediates Book: </h2>    <b>✓ Chapter 1: Objects in Python </b>  ✓ Chapter 2: Object Oriented Programming   <b>✓ Chapter 3: Functions </b>  ✓ Chapter 4: Iterator in Python   <b>✓ Chapter 5: Python Generators</b>       <h2>Start Learning Python Right Now!</h2></div>
Agile Estimating and Planning|Mike Cohn|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51I7-xMCQDL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <h3>Praise for <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> </h3> <p>""Traditional, deterministic approaches to planning and estimating simply don't cut it on the slippery slopes of today's dynamic, change-driven projects. Mike Cohn's breakthrough book gives us not only the philosophy, but also the guidelines and a proven set of tools that we need to succeed in planning, estimating, and scheduling projects with a high uncertainty factor. At the same time, the author never loses sight of the need to deliver business value to the customer each step of the way."" </p> <p>—Doug DeCarlo, author of <i>eXtreme Project Management: Using Leadership, Principles and Tools to Deliver Value in the Face of Volatility</i> (Jossey-Bass, 2004) </p> <p>""We know how to build predictive plans and manage them. But building plans that only estimate the future and then embrace change, challenge most of our training and skills. In <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i>, Mike Cohn once again fills a hole in the Agile practices, this time by showing us a workable approach to Agile estimating and planning. Mike delves into the nooks and crannies of the subject and anticipates many of the questions and nuances of this topic. Students of Agile processes will recognize that this book is truly about agility, bridging many of the practices between Scrum and ExtremeProgramming."" </p> <p>—Ken Schwaber, Scrum evangelist, Agile Alliance cofounder, and signatory to the Agile Manifesto </p> <p>""In <b> <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> </b>, Mike Cohn has, for the first time, brought together most everything that the Agile community has learned about the subject. The book is clear, well organized, and a pleasant and valuable read. It goes into all the necessary detail, and at the same time keeps the reader's burden low. We can dig in as deeply as we need to, without too much detail before we need it. The book really brings together everything we have learned about Agile estimation and planning over the past decade. It will serve its readers well."" </p> <p>—Ron Jeffries, www.XProgramming.com, author of <i>Extreme Programming Installed </i>(Addison-Wesley, 2001) and <i>Extreme Programming Adventures in C#</i> (Microsoft Press, 2004) </p> <p>""<i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> provides a view of planning that's balanced between theory and practice, and it is supported by enough concrete experiences to lend it credibility. I particularly like the quote 'planning is a quest for value.' It points to a new, more positive attitude toward planning that goes beyond the 'necessary evil' view that I sometimes hold."" </p> <p>—Kent Beck, author of <i>Extreme Programming Explained, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2005) </p> <p>""Up-front planning is still the most critical part of software development. Agile software development requires Agile planning techniques. This book shows you how to employ Agile planning in a succinct, practical, and easy-to-follow manner."" </p> <p>—Adam Rogers, Ultimate Software </p> <p>""Mike does a great follow-up to <i>User Stories Applied </i>by continuing to provide Agile teams with the practical approaches and techniques to increase agility. In this book, Mike provides time-proven and well-tested methods for being successful with the multiple levels of planning and estimating required by Agile. This book is the first to detail the disciplines of Agile estimating and planning, in ways that rival my 1980 civil engineering texts on CPM Planning and Estimating."" </p> <p>—Ryan Martens, President and Founder, Rally Software Development Corporation</p> <p>""With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software of high business value. With Agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change."" </p> <p>—Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author, <i>Fit for Developing Software</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005) </p> <p>""Finally! The groundbreaking book my clients have been clamoring for! <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> demystifies the process of defining, driving, and delivering great software that matters to the business. Mike's clarity, insight, and experience leap out through every page of this book, offering an approach that is relevant and immediately useful to all members of an Agile project.""</p> <p>—Kert D. Peterson, President, Enterprise Agile Group, LLC </p> <p>""This isn't yet another generic book on Agile software development. <b> <i>Agile Estimating and Planning</i> </b> fills a gap left by most of the other books and gives you important, practical, down-to-earth techniques needed to be successful on Agile development projects."" </p> <p>—Steve Tockey, Principal Consultant, Construx Software </p> <p>""Estimation, planning, and tracking is a trinity. If you don't do one of them, you don't need the other two. This book provides very practical knowledge for estimation, planning, prioritizing, and tracking. It should be compulsory subject matter for project managers and their teams, even if they hesitate to call themselves Agile."" </p> <p>—Niels Malotaux, Project Coach</p> <p>""Effective planning is an important, but often misunderstood, part of any successful Agile project. With <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i>, Mike Cohn has given us a definitive guide to a wide range of Agile estimating and planning practices. With his clear and practical style, Mike not only explains how to successfully get started planning an Agile project, but also provides a wealth of tips and advice for improving any team's Agile planning process. This book is a must-read for managers, coaches, and members of Agile teams."" </p> <p>—Paul Hodgetts, Agile coach and CEO, Agile Logic </p> <p>""Mike's writing style captures the essence of agility-just the right amount of information to bring clarity to the reader. This book provides an excellent guide for all Agile practitioners, both seasoned and novice."" </p> <p>—Robert Holler, President and CEO, VersionOne, LLC </p> <p>""It is as if Mike took the distilled knowledge regarding planning and estimation of a great Agile developer (which he is) and laid out all he knows in an easily understandable manner. More importantly, he has a great mix of concepts with real-world examples finished off with a case study so the reader can relate the information to their own situation. Unless you are already an expert Agile planner and estimator, this book is for you.""</p> <p>—Alan Shalloway, CEO, Senior Consultant, Net Objectives, and coauthor of <i>Design Patterns Explained, Second Edition</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2005)</p> <p>""Although I had plenty of XP experience before trying out Mike Cohn's Agile planning practices, the effectiveness of the practical and proven techniques in this book blew me away! The book recognizes that people, not tools or processes, produce great software, and that teams benefit most by learning about their project and their product as they go. The examples in the book are concrete, easily grasped, and simply reek of common sense. This book will help teams (whether Agile or not) deliver more value, more often, and have fun doing it! Whether you're a manager or a programmer, a tester or a CEO, part of an Agile team, or just looking for a way to stamp out chaos and death marches, this book will guide you."" </p> <p>—Lisa Crispin, coauthor of <i>Testing Extreme Programming</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2003) </p> <p>""Mike Cohn does an excellent job demonstrating how an Agile approach can address issues of risk and uncertainty in order to provide more meaningful estimates and plans for software projects.""</p> <p> —Todd Little, Senior Development Manager, Landmark Graphics </p> <p>""Mike Cohn explains his approach to Agile planning, and shows how 'critical chain' thinking can be used to effectively buffer both schedule and features. As with <i>User Stories Applied</i>, this book is easy to read and grounded in real-world experience."" </p> <p>—Bill Wake, author of <i>Refactoring Workbook</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2003) </p> <p>""Mike brings this book to life with real-world examples that help reveal how and why an Agile approach works for planning software development projects. This book has great breadth, ranging from the fundamentals of release planning to advanced topics such as financial aspects of prioritization. I can see this book becoming an invaluable aid to Agile project managers, as it provides a wealth of practical tips such as how to set iteration length and boot-strap velocity, and communicate progress."" </p> <p>—Rachel Davies, Independent Consultant </p> <p>""There has been a need for a solid, pragmatic book on the long-term vision of an Agile Project for project managers. <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> addresses this need.  It's not theory—this book contains project-tested practices that have been used on Agile projects. As Mike's test subjects, we applied these practices to the development of video games (one of the most unpredictable project environments you can imagine) with success."" </p> <p>—Clinton Keith, Chief Technical Officer, High Moon Studios </p> <p>""When I first heard Mike Cohn speak, I was impressed by a rare combination of qualities: deep experience and understanding in modern iterative and Agile methods; a drive to find and validate easy, high-impact solutions beyond the status quo of traditional (usually ineffective) methods; and the passion and clarity of a natural coach. These qualities are evident in this wonderful, practical guide. I estimate you won't be disappointed in studying and applying his advice."" </p> <p>—Craig Larman, Chief Scientist, Valtech, and author of <i>Applying UML and Patterns, Third Edition</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005) and <i>Agile and Iterative Development</i> (Addison-Wesley, 2004)</p> <p>""<i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> is a critical guide on how to successfully provide value to customers of IT services. This book is filled with clear examples that are essential—from project team members to the executive level.""</p> <p>—Lou Thomas, Director, Applications Development, Farm Credit Services of America</p> <p>""This work is deeply significant in that it articulates and details structured techniques to realize a simple, but profound insight—planning is an iterative quest for value, rather than a perfunctory scheduling of activities. Mike presents processes to converge on this value while reducing risk and uncertainty, supporting decision making, establishing trust, and conveying information. Agile methodologies have shifted the emphasis from plans to planning, but have glossed over many of the finer details of Agile planning. Now, very simply and accessibly, Mike demonstrates how it can be done."" </p> <p>—Sanjiv Augustine, Practice Director, Lean-Agile Consulting at CC Pace, and author of <i>Managing Agile Projects</i> (Prentice Hall, 2005) </p> <p>""The techniques described in <i> <b>Agile Estimating and Planning</b> </i> have helped us tremendously with planning and managing our projects. It provides all you have ever wanted to know about Agile project management."" </p> <p>—Roman Pichler, Engineering Manager, Siemens Communications </p> <p>""Mike Cohn presents a highly pragmatic and logical approach to making projects successful in a world beset by uncertainty and change. With his trademark clarity and directness, Mike cuts through the management mumbo jumbo to present practical techniques that can be put into use immediately. Put the odds squarely in your favor by making Mike Cohn the planning guru on your next big project."" </p> <p>—Pete Deemer, Vice President, Product Development, Yahoo!</p> <p>""This book distills the fundamental ideas behind Agile estimating and planning, presenting them in a thoughtful and approachable manner. This is a 'must-have' book that presents clear, unambiguous, and practical advice for anyone who wants to successfully manage modern software development projects.""</p> <p>—Scott W. Ambler, President, Ambysoft Inc.</p> <p>""How do your projects go? Frustrating changes? Uncertainty? Product missing both the mark and the deadline? With insight and clarity, Mike Cohn shows how to effectively produce software that is of high business value. With agile estimation and planning, you focus effort where it really counts, and continue to do so as circumstances change.""</p> <p>—Rick Mugridge, Rimu Research Ltd., and lead author of <i>Fit for Developing Software</i> </p> <p>""We are true believers in the agile methods described in this book, and have experienced a substantially positive impact from their implementation and continued use. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making their software development more practical and effective.""</p> <p>—Mark M.

Then it's about time you picked up Head First HTML and CSS, and really learned HTML. You want to learn HTML so you can finally create those web pages you've always wanted, so you can communicate more effectively with friends, family, fans, and fanatic customers. You also want to do it right so you can actually maintain and expand your web pages over time so they work in all browsers and mobile devices. Oh, and if you've never heard of CSS, that's okay--we won't tell anyone you're still partying like it's 1999--but if you're going to create web pages in the 21st century then you'll want to know and understand CSS.<br><br>Learn the real secrets of creating web pages, and why everything your boss told you about HTML tables is probably wrong (and what to do instead). Most importantly, hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions how his HTML is now strict, and his CSS is in an external style sheet.<br><br>With Head First HTML and CSS, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking web-safe colors still matter, and the foolishness of slipping a font tag into your pages. Best of all, you'll learn HTML and CSS in a way that won't put you to sleep. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect: a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, this book will load HTML and CSS into your brain in a way that sticks.<br><br>So what are you waiting for? Leave those other dusty books behind and come join us in Webville. Your tour is about to begin.</div>

It covers a much wider scope of C++ programming than other introductory books Ive seen, and in a surprisingly compact format. - Dag Bruck, founding member of the ANSI/ISO C++ committee The authors present a clear, cogent introduction to C++ programming in a way that gets the student writing nontrivial programs immediately. - Stephen Clamage, Sun Microsystems, Inc., and chair of the ANSI C++ committee Anyone reading just this one book and working through the examples and exercises will have the same skills as many professional programmers. - Jeffrey D. Oldham, Stanford University Why is Accelerated C++ so effective? Because it: *Starts with the most useful concepts rather than the most primitive ones: You can begin writing programs immediately. *Describes real problems and solutions, not just language features: You see not only what each feature is, but also how to use it. * Covers the language and standard library together: You can use the library right from the start.

Make that ‘by an order of magnitude’.... Very complete, with excellent right-to-the-point examples and intelligent, not dumbed-down, explanations.... In contrast to many other Java books I found it to be unusually mature, consistent, intellectually honest, well-written, and precise.

I was really floundering (being a non-C programmer), but your book has brought me up to speed as fast as I could read it. It’s really cool to be able to understand the underlying principles and concepts from the start, rather than having to try to build that conceptual model through trial and error. Hopefully I will be able to attend your seminar in the not-too-distant future.”<br> <i>—Randall R.

Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python SECOND EDITION|Bradley N. Miller|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YORtBDG4L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> THIS TEXTBOOK is about computer science. It is also about Python. However, there is much more. The study of algorithms and data structures is central to understanding what computer science is all about.  Learning computer science is not unlike learning any other type of difficult subject matter. The only way to be successful is through deliberate and incremental exposure to the fundamental ideas. A beginning computer scientist needs practice so that there is a thorough understanding before continuing on to the more complex parts of the curriculum. In addition, a beginner needs to be given the opportunity to be successful and gain confidence. This textbook is designed to serve as a text for a first course on data structures and algorithms, typically taught as the second course in the computer science curriculum. Even though the second course is considered more advanced than the first course, this book assumes you are beginners at this level. You may still be struggling with some of the basic ideas and skills from a first computer science course and yet be ready to further explore the discipline and continue to practice problem solving. We cover abstract data types and data structures, writing algorithms, and solving problems. We look at a number of data structures and solve classic problems that arise. The tools and techniques that you learn here will be applied over and over as you continue your study of computer science.</div>

Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change, 2nd Edition (The XP Series)|Kent Beck|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51l1X81fhiL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p> </p><blockquote>“In this second edition of <i>Extreme Programming Explained,</i> Kent Beck organizes and presents five years’ worth of experiences, growth, and change revolving around XP. If you are seriously interested in understanding how you and your team can start down the path of improvement with XP, you must read this book.”<br> <br>—<b>Francesco Cirillo,</b> Chief Executive Officer, XPLabs S.R.L. </blockquote> <blockquote>“The first edition of this book told us what XP was—it changed the way many of us think about software development. This second edition takes it farther and gives us a lot more of the ‘why’ of XP, the motivations and the principles behind the practices. This is great stuff. Armed with the ‘what’ and the ‘why,’ we can now all set out to confidently work on the ‘how’: how to run our projects better, and how to get agile techniques adopted in our organizations.”<br> <br>—<b>Dave Thomas,</b> The Pragmatic Programmers LLC </blockquote> <blockquote>“This book is dynamite! It was revolutionary when it first appeared a few years ago, and this new edition is equally profound. For those who insist on cookbook checklists, there’s an excellent chapter on ‘primary practices,’ but I urge you to begin by truly contemplating the meaning of the opening sentence in the first chapter of Kent Beck’s book: ‘XP is about social change.’ You should do whatever it takes to ensure that every IT professional and every IT manager—all the way up to the CIO—has a copy of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> on his or her desk.”<br> <br> —<b>Ed Yourdon,</b> author and consultant </blockquote> <blockquote>“XP is a powerful set of concepts for simplifying the process of software design, development, and testing. It is about minimalism and incrementalism, which are especially useful principles when tackling complex problems that require a balance of creativity and discipline.”<br> <br> —<b>Michael A. Cusumano,</b> Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of <i>The Business of Software</i> </blockquote> <blockquote>“<i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is the work of a talented and passionate craftsman. Kent Beck has brought together a compelling collection of ideas about programming and management that deserves your full attention. My only beef is that our profession has gotten to a point where such common-sense ideas are labeled ‘extreme.’...”<br> <br> —<b>Lou Mazzucchelli,</b> Fellow, Cutter Business Technology Council</blockquote> <blockquote>“If your organization is ready for a change in the way it develops software, there’s the slow incremental approach, fixing things one by one, or the fast track, jumping feet first into Extreme Programming. Do not be frightened by the name, it is not that extreme at all. It is mostly good old recipes and common sense, nicely integrated together, getting rid of all the fat that has accumulated over the years.”<br> <br> —<b>Philippe Kruchten,</b> UBC, Vancouver, British Columbia</blockquote> <blockquote>“Sometimes revolutionaries get left behind as the movement they started takes on a life of its own. In this book, Kent Beck shows that he remains ahead of the curve, leading XP to its next level. Incorporating five years of feedback, this book takes a fresh look at what it takes to develop better software in less time and for less money. There are no silver bullets here, just a set of practical principles that, when used wisely, can lead to dramatic improvements in software development productivity.”<br> <br> —<b>Mary Poppendieck,</b> author of <i>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</i> </blockquote> <blockquote>“Kent Beck has revised his classic book based on five more years of applying and teaching XP. He shows how the path to XP is both easy and hard: It can be started with fewer practices, and yet it challenges teams to go farther than ever.”<br> <br> —<b>William Wake,</b> independent consultant </blockquote> <blockquote>“With new insights, wisdom from experience, and clearer explanations of the art of Extreme Programming, this edition of Beck’s classic will help many realize the dream of outstanding software development.”<br> <br>—<b>Joshua Kerievsky,</b> author of <i>Refactoring to Patterns</i> and Founder, Industrial Logic, Inc.</blockquote> <blockquote>“XP has changed the way our industry thinks about software development. Its brilliant simplicity, focused execution, and insistence on fact-based planning over speculation have set a new standard for software delivery.”<br> <br>—<b>David Trowbridge, </b>Architect, Microsoft Corporation</blockquote> <p>Accountability. Transparency. Responsibility. These are not words that are often applied to software development. </p> <p>In this completely revised introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), Kent Beck describes how to improve your software development by integrating these highly desirable concepts into your daily development process.</p> <p>The first edition of <i>Extreme Programming Explained</i> is a classic. It won awards for its then-radical ideas for improving small-team development, such as having developers write automated tests for their own code and having the whole team plan weekly. Much has changed in five years. This completely rewritten second edition expands the scope of XP to teams of any size by suggesting a program of continuous improvement based on:</p> <ul> <li>Five core values consistent with excellence in software development</li> <li>Eleven principles for putting those values into action</li> <li>Thirteen primary and eleven corollary practices to help you push development past its current business and technical limitations</li> </ul> <p>Whether you have a small team that is already closely aligned with your customers or a large team in a gigantic or multinational organization, you will find in these pages a wealth of ideas to challenge, inspire, and encourage you and your team members to substantially improve your software development. </p> <p>You will discover how to:</p> <ul> <li>Involve the whole team—XP style</li> <li>Increase technical collaboration through pair programming and continuous integration</li> <li>Reduce defects through developer testing</li> <li>Align business and technical decisions through weekly and quarterly planning</li> <li>Improve teamwork by setting up an informative, shared workspace</li> </ul> <p>You will also find many other concrete ideas for improvement, all based on a philosophy that emphasizes simultaneously increasing the humanity and effectiveness of software development.</p> <p>Every team can improve. Every team can begin improving today.

You should be an intermediate level C# developer with some experience in HTML5 and CSS3. The book presupposes that you have a solid C# foundation since the language won't be explained in any detail.<br><br>You will learn ASP.NET Core 1.1 by building two MVC applications. The first application will be built using an empty template. The goal is to get you familiar with ASP.NET Core 1.1 by adding middleware and services one piece at a time, building a basic application. Then you will build a second MVC application using a template that already contains support for MVC, Entity Framework Core, and user authentication. This application is a video course website, where users can register to gain access to video courses.<br><br>If you are already familiar with MVC 5, the content in this book can get you started with ASP.NET Core 1.1 in a fast, no-fluff way.<br><br>It's important to mention that this book is practical and tactical, where you will learn as you progress through the modules and build real web applications in the process. To spare you countless pages of fluff (filler material), only valuable information, pertinent to the task at hand, is discussed. The benefit is a shorter and more condensed book, which will save you time and give you a more enjoyable experience.<br><br>The goal is to learn ASP.NET Core 1.1 by building two web applications, one from scratch and one from an existing template. This experience is something you can put in your CV when applying for a job or a consultant position, or when negotiating a higher salary.<br><br><b>Technologies, frameworks and languages you will use:</b><br>* ASP.NET Core 1.1 MVC (The framework that you will use)<br>* Services (To provide you own functionality as a reusable service)<br>* Middleware (To provide you own functionality to HTTP Request pipeline)<br>* Entity Framework (To crate and communicate with a database)<br>* View Component (To render data in the _Layout view with model data)<br>* Razor syntax (To include server-side code in views)<br>* Bootstrap (Used for styling and to create a responsive design)<br>* LINQ (To query the database)<br>* Dependency Injection (To inject objects into constructors)<br>* Tag Helper (to clean up the HTML and enable re-use)<br>* HTML Helper methods (to clean up your HTML and enable re-use)<br>* Bower/NuGet (To install necessary front-end/back-end libraries)<br><br><b>What you will implement:</b><br>* Implement a web application from an empty template.<br>* Implement a web application from an existing template.<br>* Create a ""real world"" code-first database using Entity Framework Core.<br>* Add and modify models, views and controllers to perform CRUD operations against the database.<br>* Use client-side and server-side validation.<br>* Secure the controllers, actions and view content with authorization and roles.<br>* Styling HTML with CSS and Bootstrap.<br>* Create a responsive website.<br>* Register users with the site.<br>* Manage users and their video courses.<br><br>Have questions?

Practical Computing for Biologists|Steven H. D. Haddock|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41PSjVVSqoL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Increasingly, scientists find themselves facing exponentially larger data sets and analyses without suitable tools to deal with them. Many biologists end up using spreadsheet programs for most of their data-processing tasks and spend hours clicking around or copying and pasting, and then repeating the process for other data files.<br><br><em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> shows you how to use many freely available computing tools to work more powerfully and effectively. The book was born out of the authors' own experience in developing tools for their research and helping other biologists with their computational problems. Although many of the techniques are relevant to molecular bioinformatics, the motivation for the book is much broader, focusing on topics and techniques that are applicable to a range of scientific endeavors. Twenty-two chapters organized into six parts address these topics (and more; see Contents):<br><br><br> *Searching with regular expressions<br><br>*The Unix command line<br><br> *Python programming and debugging<br><br> *Creating and editing graphics<br><br> *Databases<br><br> *Performing analyses on remote servers<br><br> *Working with electronics<br><br><br><br><br>While most of the concepts and examples apply to any operating system, the main narrative focuses on Mac OS X. Where there are differences for Windows and Linux users, parallel instructions are provided in the margin and in an appendix. The book is designed to be used as a self-guided resource for researchers, a companion book in a course, or as a primary textbook. <em>Practical Computing for Biologists</em> will free you from the most frustrating and time-consuming aspects of data processing so you can focus on the pleasures of scientific inquiry.<br><br><br><strong>RESOURCES</strong><br><br><strong>For Students</strong><br><br>The Companion Website includes downloads, community forums, tips and examples, and textbook errata and updates.<br><br><strong>For Instructors</strong><br><br>The Instructor's Resource Library features all of the textbook's figures and tables, provided in ready-to-use PowerPoint presentations.<br></div>

Create concurrent applications, but get them right without all the locking and consistency headaches. Meet Elixir, a modern, functional, concurrent language built on the rock-solid Erlang VM. Elixir's pragmatic syntax and built-in support for metaprogramming will make you productive and keep you interested for the long haul. Maybe the time is right for the Next Big Thing. Maybe it's Elixir. This book is <i>the</i> introduction to Elixir for experienced programmers, completely updated for Elixir 1.3.</p><p>Functional programming techniques help you manage the complexities of today's real-world, concurrent systems; maximize uptime; and manage security. Enter Elixir, with its modern, Ruby-like, extendable syntax, compile and runtime evaluation, hygienic macro system, and more. But, just as importantly, Elixir brings a sense of enjoyment to parallel, functional programming. Your applications become fun to work with, and the language encourages you to experiment.</p><p>Part 1 covers the basics of writing sequential Elixir programs. We'll look at the language, the tools, and the conventions. Part 2 uses these skills to start writing concurrent code-applications that use all the cores on your machine, or all the machines on your network! And we do it both with and without OTP. Part 3 looks at the more advanced features of the language, from DSLs and code generation toextending the syntax.</p><p>This edition is fully updated with all the new features of Elixir 1.3, with a new chapter on Tooling, covering testing (both conventional and property based), code and dependency exploration, and servermonitoring.<bp>By the end of this book, you'll understand Elixir, and know how to apply it to solve your complex, modern problems.<p><b>What You Need:</b><br><br>You'll need a computer, a little experience with another high-level language, and a sense of adventure. No functional programming experience is needed.</p></bp></p></div></div>

Displaying extraordinary creativity and programming virtuosity, Alexandrescu offers a cutting-edge approach to design that unites design patterns, generic programming, and C++, enabling programmers to achieve expressive, flexible, and highly reusable code.</p> <p style=""margin:0px;""> </p> <p style=""margin:0px;"">This book introduces the concept of generic components—reusable design templates that produce boilerplate code for compiler consumption—all within C++. Generic components enable an easier and more seamless transition from design to application code, generate code that better expresses the original design intention, and support the reuse of design structures with minimal recoding.</p> <p style=""margin:0px;""> </p> <p style=""margin:0px;"">The author describes the specific C++ techniques and features that are used in building generic components and goes on to implement industrial strength generic components for real-world applications. Recurring issues that C++ developers face in their day-to-day activity are discussed in depth and implemented in a generic way. These include:</p> <ul> <li>Policy-based design for flexibility</li> <li>Partial template specialization</li> <li>Typelists—powerful type manipulation structures</li> <li>Patterns such as Visitor, Singleton, Command, and Factories</li> <li>Multi-method engines</li> </ul> <p style=""margin:0px;"">For each generic component, the book presents the fundamental problems and design options, and finally implements a generic solution. </p> <p style=""margin:0px;""> </p> <p style=""margin:0px;"">In addition, an accompanying Web site, <i>http://www.awl.com/cseng/titles/0-201-70431-5</i>, makes the code implementations available for the generic components in the book and provides a free, downloadable C++ library, called Loki, created by the author.

Patt (Author),|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MHRPUGZML._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <i>Introduction to Computing Systems: From bits &amp; gates to C &amp; beyond</i>, now in its second edition, is designed to give students a better understanding of computing early in their college careers in order to give them a stronger foundation for later courses. The book is in two parts: (a) the underlying structure of a computer, and (b) programming in a high level language and programming methodology.    <p>To understand the computer, the authors introduce the LC-3 and provide the LC-3 Simulator to give students hands-on access for testing what they learn. To develop their understanding of programming and programming methodology, they use the C programming language.  The book takes a ""motivated"" bottom-up approach, where the students first get exposed to the big picture and then start at the bottom and build their knowledge bottom-up.  Within each smaller unit, the same motivated bottom-up approach is followed.  Every step of the way, students learn new things, building on what they already know.  The authors feel that this approach encourages deeper understanding and downplays the need for memorizing.  Students develop a greater breadth of understanding, since they see how the various parts of the computer fit together.</p></div>"

Data Structures and Algorithms in Java|Michael T. Goodrich (Author),|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51h-X7nsZvL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> The design and analysis of efficient data structures has long been recognized as a key component of the Computer Science curriculum. Goodrich and Tomassia's approach to this classic topic is based on the object-oriented paradigm as the framework of choice for the design of data structures. For each ADT presented in the text, the authors provide an associated Java interface. Concrete data structures realizing the ADTs are provided as Java classes implementing the interfaces. The Java code implementing fundamental data structures in this book is organized in a single Java package, net.datastructures. This package forms a coherent library of data structures and algorithms in Java specifically designed for educational purposes in a way that is complimentary with the Java Collections Framework.</div>

In this one-of-a-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to <i>Think Like a Programmer</i>. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, like classes, pointers, and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughout challenge you to apply your knowledge. You'll also learn how to:</p><p></p><ul><li>Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve</li><li>Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries</li><li>Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job</li><li>Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory</li><li>Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems</li></ul><p>Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the realm of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative art—and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to <i>Think Like a Programmer</i>.</p></div></div>

It has no concept of classes, and you don't even need to define any objects in order to write code. But don't be fooled—JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and expressive object-oriented language that puts many design decisions right into your hands.<br><br>In <i>The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript</i>, Nicholas C. Zakas thoroughly explores JavaScript's object-oriented nature, revealing the language's unique implementation of inheritance and other key characteristics. You'll learn:<br><br></p><ul><li>The difference between primitive and reference values</li><li>What makes JavaScript functions so unique</li><li>The various ways to create objects</li><li>How to define your own constructors</li><li>How to work with and understand prototypes</li><li>Inheritance patterns for types and objects</li></ul><br><br><i>The Principles of Object-Oriented JavaScript</i> will leave even experienced developers with a deeper understanding of JavaScript. Unlock the secrets behind how objects work in JavaScript so you can write clearer, more flexible, and more efficient code.</div></div>

Then once you've got the basics down, the real black belt master-class begins: you'll learn to use applicative functors, monads, zippers, and all the other mythical Haskell constructs you've only read about in storybooks.</p><p>As you work your way through the author's imaginative (and occasionally insane) examples, you'll learn to:</p> <ul><li>Laugh in the face of side effects as you wield purely functional programming techniques</li> <li>Use the magic of Haskell's ""laziness"" to play with infinite sets of data</li> <li>Organize your programs by creating your own types, type classes, and modules</li> <li>Use Haskell's elegant input/output system to share the genius of your programs with the outside world</li> </ul><p>Short of eating the author's brain, you will not find a better way to learn this powerful language than reading <i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</i></p></div>  <div class=""aplus""> <span class=""h1""><strong>Excerpt from the Introduction</strong></span>  <p><strong>Haskell is fun, and that’s what it’s all about!</strong></p> <p>This book is aimed at people who have experience programming in imperative languages—such as C++, Java, and Python—and now want to try out Haskell. But even if you don’t have any significant programming experience, I’ll bet a smart person like you will be able to follow along and learn Haskell.</p>  <p>My first reaction to Haskell was that the language was just too weird. But after getting over that initial hurdle, it was smooth sailing. Even if Haskell seems strange to you at  first, don’t give up. Learning Haskell is almost like learning to program for the first time all over again. It’s fun, and it forces you to think differently.</p> <p><strong>NOTE</strong><br>  <i>If you ever get really stuck, the IRC channel</i> #haskell <i>on the freenode network is a great place to ask questions. The people there tend to be nice, patient, and understanding. They’re a great resource for Haskell newbies.</i> </p><p><strong>So, What's Haskell?</strong></p>  <table align=""right"" bgcolor=""#ffffff"" cellpadding=""3"" cellspacing=""3"">   <tbody><tr>    <td align=""center""><img src=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/oreilly/fx152x149.jpg"" align=""center"" border=""0""></td>   </tr>   </tbody></table>   <p>Haskell is a <i>purely</i> functional programming language.</p>  <p>In <i>imperative</i> programming languages, you give the computer a sequence of tasks, which it then executes. While executing them, the computer can change state. For instance, you can set the variable a to 5 and then do some stuff that might change the value of a. There are also flow-control structures for executing instructions several times, such as for and while loops.</p>  <p>Purely functional programming is different. You don’t tell the computer what to do—you tell it what stuff is. For instance, you can tell the computer that the factorial of a number is the product of every integer from 1 to that number or that the sum of a list of numbers is the first number plus the sum of the remaining numbers. You can express both of these operations as functions.</p>  <p>&gt; Read the <a href=""https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/oreilly/Haskell_Excerpt.pdf"">Introduction</a> (PDF) in its entirety.</p>    </div></div>"

A Smarter Way to Learn jQuery: Learn it faster. Remember it longer. (Volume 3)|Mark Myers|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41KD6ppOK6L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> You’re going to get the hang of jQuery in less time than you might expect. And the knowledge will stick.           Why? Because this isn’t just a book. It’s a book plus 1,500 free interactive online exercises. It’s the exercises that are going to turn you into a real jQuery coder.           Cognitive research shows that reading alone doesn’t buy you much long-term retention. But if you read less and do more—if you read a short passage and then immediately put it into practice—everything changes. Washington University researchers say that being asked to retrieve information increases long-term retention by four hundred percent.           Practice also makes learning more interesting. Ten minutes of reading followed by twenty minutes of practice keeps you awake and spurs you on.          And it keeps you honest. If you only read, it’s easy to kid yourself that you’re learning more than you are. But when you’re challenged to produce the goods, there’s a moment of truth. You know that you know—or that you don’t. If you find you’re a little shaky on this point or that, you can review the material, then re-do the exercise. That’s all it takes to master this book from beginning to end.</div>

The Java programming language and BlueJ—the Java development environment — are the two tools used throughout the book. <b> <i> </i> </b>BlueJ's clear visualization of classes and objects means that readers can immediately appreciate the differences between them and gain a much better understanding of the nature of an object than they would from simply reading source code.

The book’s exploration of this new language demonstrates a renaissance of functional ideas in modern programming. While functional programming isn’t new in principle, it’s seen a boost in popularity based on the current computer hardware available and the changing nature of projects programmers wish to tackle. Functional language constructs make it possible to efficiently automate currency, make use of multiple cores without much effort on the side of the programmer, are both more elegant and readable, and offer great potential in solving the issue of parallel hardware. Functional programming has become an essential part of the field, and <b> <i>Objects First with Java </i> </b>gives students a basic understanding of an area they’ll need to master in order to succeed in the future.</p></div>"

It uses the Java programming language to introduce the principles of  object-oriented programming. It is the latest version in the <i>Karel The Robot</i> series, originally developed by Richard Pattis. It is a true successor to the original, emphasizing problem solving in a simple but ""Turing Complete"" and interesting virtual world.   </p><p> <i>Karel J Robot</i> stresses problem solving rather than language syntax. It has been shown to be an effective learning environment for novice programmers. A student able to do the exercises in this book, or one of its companions, is truly on his or her way to a deep understanding of programming.   </p><p> Learn to write sophisticated Java code in a few weeks. It is not a comprehensive treatment of Java, but emphasizes problem solving using objects, writing classes, and developing skill in algorithmic and polymorphic thinking. It goes beyond thinking of computing as just ""if"" and ""while"".   </p><p> The advantages pointed out by reviewers of <i>Karel J Robot</i> follow:   </p><p> <i>Karel J Robot</i> is an excellent introduction to modern computer science, without letting students get overwhelmed by the details of a programming language (even though it is real Java). KJR provides a framework for understanding Object-Oriented Programming from the very beginning. Students are encouraged to develop problem-solving skills by producing projects that solve very complex problems with a relatively small set of tools.  <br>Don Slater, Carnegie-Mellon University  </p><p> I have been successfully introducing students in grades 9 through 12 to programming using Karel for the past twenty years and <i>Karel J Robot</i> is the most effective version yet. Students love it! They find principles of OOP (class design, constructors, methods, inheritance, polymorphism) come naturally to them, even before they learn about control structures. They discover recursive solutions without ever being taught recursion. Best of all, Karel is gender neutral --- both girls and boys are so involved and excited that I have to push them out the door and on to their next class when the period ends.  <br>Kathy Larson, Kingston High School, Kingston New York  </p><p> <i>Karel J Robot: A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Object-Oriented Programming in Java</i> takes you on a well-sequenced and thoughtful journey through the essential concepts in a first semester computer science course. Experience computer science at the level that it is most inspiring – the conceptual level. The visual environment will help you teach and your students learn because everyone will have immediate visual feedback, enabling them to see what they are doing. You will leave the Karel world with a deep understanding of polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, modularization, and step-wise refinement, to name just a few topics. If you are an AP Computer Science teacher, you have just found the perfect guide to help ensure you do not lose sight of the forest (i.e., computer science) through the trees (i.e., the details of the language).  <br>Dave Wittry, Troy High School  </p><p> <i>Karel J Robot</i> provides an uncluttered setting for laying the foundation for all of the key OO concepts.

The Little Schemer - 4th Edition|Daniel P. Friedman|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41vFTwjzvbL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p>The notion that ""thinking about computing is one of the most exciting things the human mind can do"" sets both  <i>The Little Schemer </i>(formerly known as  <i>The Little LISPer</i>) and its new companion volume,  <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i>, apart from other books on LISP. The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about.  <i>The Little Schemer</i> introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas.  <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases.  <i>The Little LISPer</i> has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese.  <i>The Little Schemer</i> and  <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science. </p></div>"

|Michael S. Sherry||"<div> Today it is widely recognized that gay men played a prominent role in defining the culture of mid-twentieth-century America, with such icons as Tennessee Williams, Edward Albee, Aaron Copland, Samuel Barber, Montgomery Clift, and Rock Hudson defining much of what seemed distinctly ""American"" on the stage and screen. Even though few gay artists were ""out,"" their sexuality caused significant anxiety during a time of rampant antihomosexual attitudes. Michael Sherry offers a sophisticated analysis of the tension between the nation's simultaneous dependence on and fear of the cultural influence of gay artists.<br><br>Sherry places conspiracy theories about the ""homintern"" (homosexual international) taking control and debasing American culture within the paranoia of the time that included anticommunism, anti-Semitism, and racism. Gay artists, he argues, helped shape a lyrical, often nationalist version of American modernism that served the nation's ambitions to create a cultural empire and win the Cold War. Their success made them valuable to the country's cultural empire but also exposed them to rising antigay sentiment voiced even at the highest levels of power (for example, by President Richard Nixon). Only late in the twentieth century, Sherry concludes, did suspicion slowly give way to an uneasy accommodation of gay artists' place in American life.<br><br></div>"

Types and Programming Languages (MIT Press)|Benjamin C. Pierce|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41C%2BmdXHDKL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.</p><p>This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.</p><p>The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.</p></div>

Whether or not your favorite language is on that list, you'll broaden your perspective of programming by examining these languages side-by-side. You'll learn something new from each, and best of all, you'll learn how to learn a language quickly.<br><br>Ruby, Io, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, Haskell.  With <i>Seven Languages in Seven Weeks,</i> by Bruce A. Tate, you'll go beyond the syntax-and beyond the 20-minute tutorial you'll find someplace online.  This book has an audacious goal: to present a meaningful exploration of seven languages within a single book.  Rather than serve as a complete reference or installation guide, <i>Seven Languages</i> hits what's essential and unique about each language.  Moreover, this approach will help teach you how to grok new languages.<br><br>For each language, you'll solve a nontrivial problem, using techniques that show off the language's most important features.  As the book proceeds, you'll discover the strengths and weaknesses of the languages, while dissecting the process of learning languages quickly--for example, finding the typing and programming models, decision structures, and how you interact with them.<br><br>Among this group of seven, you'll explore the most critical programming models of our time.  Learn the dynamic typing that makes Ruby, Python, and Perl so flexible and compelling. Understand the underlying prototype system that's at the heart of JavaScript. See how pattern matching in Prolog shaped the development of Scala and Erlang. Discover how pure functional programming in Haskell is different from the Lisp family of languages, including Clojure.<br><br>Explore the concurrency techniques that are quickly becoming the backbone of a new generation of Internet applications. Find out how to use Erlang's let-it-crash philosophy for building fault-tolerant systems. Understand the actor model that drives concurrency design in Io and Scala.  Learn how Clojure uses versioning to solve some of the most difficult concurrency problems.<br><br>It's all here, all in one place.  Use the concepts from one language to find creative solutions in another-or discover a language that may become one of your favorites.</p></div>

The Business Analyst's Handbook|Howard Podeswa|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51b7sayNKNL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> The Business Analyst (BA) plays an important role as liaison between business stakeholders and the technical team (software developers, vendors, etc.), ensuring that business needs are reflected in any software solution. Despite the importance of the job, there is currently no book specifically designed as a comprehensive reference manual for the working BA. The Business Analyst's Handbook solves this problem by providing a useful compendium of tools, tables, lists, and templates that BAs can use on-the-job to carry out their tasks. For example, you might be preparing for an interview session and use the book's checklist of interviewees to verify whether there is appropriate coverage of business stakeholders. Or you might be asked to review some diagrams and refer to the Glossaries of Symbols (organized by diagram type) for guidance. Or you may be asked to prepare textual requirements documentation and refer to the Business Requirement template for a list of artifacts and table of contents. Whatever your BA needs, the Business Analyst's Handbook places the necessary information right at your fingertips.</div>
C++: The Ultimate Beginners Guide to C++ Programing|Steve Tale|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31v5pmzAJCL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <h2>C++: The Ultimate Beginners Guide to C++ Programing</h2>  This book contains proven steps and strategies on how to successfully write programs in C++.  It gives you an introduction as well as guides you all throughout the programming language.  C++ is a general purpose object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is an extension of the C language. If you are familiar with C, you will not have a hard time grasping this language. You can code C++ in an object-oriented style or C style. In some instances, this programming language may be coded either way. Why is this possible? It is because C++ is also a hybrid language. Furthermore, it’s regarded as an intermediate-level language because it encapsulates both low- and high-level language features.  In the real world, C++ is widely used. In fact, it is very common amongst system and application software, client-server applications, embedded firmware, and software drivers. It is practically a collection of pre-defined classes or data types that you can instantiate. It also facilitates user-defined class declaration. You can make the classes accommodate member functions in order to implement functionality. The objects of a certain class can be defined in order to implement functions within a class.  These objects can also be defined as instances that are made during run time. The classes may be inherited by the other classes. They actually take the public in. Plus, they protect functionalities. Moreover, this programming language involves the use of operators such as arithmetic, comparison, logical, and bit manipulation. It allows for the overloading of operators, making it a highly attractive language for programmers.  <b>Order your copy now!</b></div>

It runs on all major platforms in a huge array of use cases. Coding in Python minimizes development time and increases productivity in comparison to other languages. Clean, maintainable code is easy to both read and write using Python's clear, concise syntax.</p><p>Object-oriented programming is a popular design paradigm in which data and behaviors are encapsulated in such a way that they can be manipulated together. Many modern programming languages utilize the powerful concepts behind object-oriented programming and Python is no exception. </p><p>Starting with a detailed analysis of object-oriented analysis and design, you will use the Python programming language to clearly grasp key concepts from the object-oriented paradigm. This book fully explains classes, data encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and exceptions with an emphasis on when you can use each principle to develop well-designed software.</p><p>You'll get an in-depth analysis of many common object-oriented design patterns that are more suitable to Python's unique style. This book will not just teach Python syntax, but will also build your confidence in how to program.</p><p>You will also learn how to create maintainable applications by studying higher level design patterns. Following this, you'll learn the complexities of string and file manipulation, and how Python distinguishes between binary and textual data. Not one, but two very powerful automated testing systems will be introduced in the book. After you discover the joy of unit testing and just how easy it can be, you'll study higher level libraries such as database connectors and GUI toolkits and learn how they uniquely apply object-oriented principles. You'll learn how these principles will allow you to make greater use of key members of the Python eco-system such as Django and Kivy.</p><p>This new edition includes all the topics that made Python 3 Object-oriented Programming an instant Packt classic. It's also packed with updated content to reflect recent changes in the core Python library and covers modern third-party packages that were not available on the Python 3 platform when the book was first published.</p><h2>Style and approach</h2><p>Throughout the book you will learn key object-oriented programming techniques demonstrated by comprehensive case studies in the context of a larger project.</p></div>

All patterns include concrete examples using Scala and Akka. Foreword by Jonas Bonér. </p> <p>Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications.</p> <p><b>About the Technology</b></p> <p>Modern web applications serve potentially vast numbers of users - and they need to keep working as servers fail and new ones come online, users overwhelm limited resources, and information is distributed globally. A Reactive application adjusts to partial failures and varying loads, remaining responsive in an ever-changing distributed environment. The secret is message-driven architecture - and design patterns to organize it.</p> <p><b>About the Book</b></p> <p><i>Reactive Design Patterns</i> presents the principles, patterns, and best practices of Reactive application design. You'll learn how to keep one slow component from bogging down others with the Circuit Breaker pattern, how to shepherd a many-staged transaction to completion with the Saga pattern, how to divide datasets by Sharding, and more. You'll even see how to keep your source code readable and the system testable despite many potential interactions and points of failure. </p> <p><b>What's Inside</b></p> <ul><li>The definitive guide to the Reactive Manifesto</li><li>Patterns for flow control, delimited consistency, fault tolerance, and much more</li><li>Hard-won lessons about what doesn't work</li><li>Architectures that scale under tremendous load</li></ul> <p><b>About the Reader</b></p> <p>Most examples use Scala, Java, and Akka.

Kotlin for Android Developers: Learn Kotlin the easy way while developing an Android App|Antonio Leiva (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41yEbISoeGL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> Google has officially announced Kotlin as a supported language to write Android Apps.  These are amazing news for Android developers, which now have the ability to use a modern and powerful language to make their job easier and funnier.  But this comes with other responsibilities. If you want to be a good candidate for new Android opportunities, Kotlin is becoming a new need most companies will ask for. So it's your time to start learning about it!  And ""Kotlin for Android Developers"" is the best tool. Recommended by both Google and Jetbrains, this book will guide through the process of learning all the new features that Java was missing, in an easy and fun way.  You'll be creating an Android app from ground using Kotlin as the main language. The idea is to learn the language by example, instead of following a typical structure. I'll be stopping to explain the most interesting concepts and ideas about Kotlin, comparing it with Java 7. This way, you can see what the differences are and which parts of the language will help you speed up your work.  This book is not meant to be a language reference, but a tool for Android developers to learn Kotlin and be able to continue with their own projects by themselves. I'll be solving many of the typical problems we have to face in our daily lives by making use of the language expressiveness and some other really interesting tools and libraries.  The book is very practical, so it is recommended to follow the examples and the code in front of a computer and try everything it's suggested. You could, however, take a first read to get a broad idea and then dive into practice.</div>"

Sed & Awk|Dale Dougherty|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51zGTApa8%2BL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p><i>sed &amp; awk</i> describes two text processing programs that are mainstays of the UNIX programmer's toolbox.<i>sed</i> is a ""stream editor"" for editing streams of text that might be too large to edit as a single file, or that might be generated on the fly as part of a larger data processing step. The most common operation done with <i>sed</i> is substitution, replacing one block of text with another.<i>awk</i> is a complete programming language. Unlike many conventional  languages, <i>awk</i> is ""data driven"" -- you specify what kind of data you  are interested in and the operations to be performed when that data is  found. <i>awk</i> does many things for you, including automatically  opening and closing data files, reading records, breaking the records up  into fields, and counting the records. While <i>awk</i> provides the  features of most conventional programming languages, it also includes some  unconventional features, such as extended regular expression matching and  associative arrays. <i>sed &amp; awk</i> describes both programs in detail  and includes a chapter of example <i>sed</i> and <i>awk</i> scripts.This edition covers features of <i>sed</i> and <i>awk</i> that are  mandated by the POSIX standard. This most notably affects <i>awk</i>, where  POSIX standardized a new variable, CONVFMT, and new functions, <i>toupper</i>()  and <i>tolower</i>(). The CONVFMT variable specifies the conversion format  to use when converting numbers to strings (<i>awk</i> used to use OFMT for this  purpose). The <i>toupper</i>() and <i>tolower</i>() functions each take a  (presumably mixed case) string argument and return a new version of the  string with all letters translated to the corresponding case.In addition, this edition covers GNU <i>sed</i>, newly available since the first edition. It also updates the first edition coverage of Bell Labs <i>nawk</i>  and GNU <i>awk</i> (<i>gawk</i>), covers <i>mawk</i>, an additional freely  available implementation of <i>awk</i>, and briefly discusses three commercial versions of <i>awk</i>, MKS <i>awk</i>, Thompson Automation <i>awk</i>  (<i>tawk</i>), and Videosoft (VSAwk).</p></div>"

The Definitive ANTLR 4 Reference|Terence Parr|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41bREmDQ9cL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process.  ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top.  This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling <i>Definitive ANTLR Reference</i> shows you how to take advantage of these new features.<br><br>Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor).  You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. <br><br>You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. <br><br>You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism.  The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class-&gt;interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru!<br><br><b>What You Need:</b><br><br>ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools.

Great programmers practice to keep their skills sharp.  Get sharp and stay sharp with more than fifty practice exercises rooted in real-world scenarios. If you're a new programmer, these challenges will help you learn what you need to break into the field, and if you're a seasoned pro, you can use these exercises to learn that hot new language for your next gig.</p><p>One of the best ways to learn a programming language is to use it to solve problems. That's what this book is all about. Instead of questions rooted in theory, this book presents problems you'll encounter in everyday software development. These problems are designed for people learning their first programming language, and they also provide a learning path for experienced developers to learn a new language quickly.</p><p>Start with simple input and output programs. Do some currency conversion and figure out how many months it takes to pay off a credit card. Calculate blood alcohol content and determine if it's safe to drive. Replace words in files and filter records, and use web services to display the weather, store data, and show how many people are in space right now. At the end you'll tackle a few larger programs that will help you bring everything together.</p><p>Each problem includes constraints and challenges to push you further, but it's up to you to come up with the solutions.  And next year, when you want to learn a new programming language or style of programming (perhaps OOP vs. functional), you can work through this book again, using new approaches to solve familiar problems.<br><br><b>What You Need:</b><br><br>You need access to a computer, a programming language reference, and the programming language you want to use.</p></div></div>

This easy-to-use tool boosts your productivity and is widely used in industry. So you'll be working like a pro right from the start.</li><li>It takes the mystery out of object-oriented programming by using real-world applications (instead of objects like cats and dogs) to demonstrate key concepts like inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.</li><li>It covers the most useful features introduced in Java SE 7, like the try-with-resources statement, the diamond operator (&lt;&gt;), and an improved file system API (known as NIO2).</li><li>In the GUI section, it shows you how to use the NetBeans Swing GUI builder to design a form and generate the code needed to display it. As a result, this section has you focus on critical coding skills, such as handling events, instead of on code that should be generated.</li><li>Because business applications routinely handle data, it shows how to work with text files, binary files, XML files, and databases (using JDBC).</li><li>It now has a chapter on deploying applications by using executable JAR files or Java Web Start.</li><li>It gives you the Java skills that you need to get started with Android programming.

Purely Functional Data Structures|Chris Okasaki|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PmFnDAqJL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Most books on data structures assume an imperative language such as C or C++.  However, data structures for these languages do not always translate well to functional languages such as Standard ML, Haskell, or Scheme.  This book describes data structures from the point of view of functional languages, with examples, and presents design techniques that allow programmers to develop their own functional data structures.  The author includes both classical data structures, such as red-black trees and binomial queues, and a host of new data structures developed exclusively for functional languages.  All source code is given in Standard ML and Haskell, and most of the programs are easily adaptable to other functional languages. This handy reference for professional programmers working with functional languages can also be used as a tutorial or for self-study.</div>

Murach's JavaScript, 2nd Edition|Mary Delamater|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51rEEyn22ML._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>Today, JavaScript is used in 89.9% of all websites, including the most heavily-trafficked sites like Google, Facebook, YouTube, and Amazon. That's why every web developer should know how to use JavaScript. The problem is that JavaScript is surprisingly difficult to learn, not only for programming novices but also for experienced programmers. But now, Murach's JavaScript (2nd Edition) makes it easier than ever to become an accomplished JavaScript programmer.</p><p>To make that possible, section 1 of this book presents a six-chapter course in JavaScript that gets you off to a great start. This section works for programming novices as well as experienced programmers because it lets you set your own pace. When you finish this section, you'll be able to write, test, and debug JavaScript applications of your own.</p><p>Then, section 2 builds on that base by presenting the additional skills that every JavaScript programmer must have. That includes working with arrays and web storage, creating and using your own object types in object-oriented applications, using regular expressions for data validation, and much more. For many developers, sections 1 and 2 will be all that they need to know.</p><p>But for those who want to move on to the expert level, section 3 presents the skills that will get you there. That includes skills like how to bulletproof your applications by using closures, namespaces, and modules; how to make your functions more useful by using callbacks; and how to use JSON to transmit and store data. Then, the last chapter in this section introduces you to jQuery and shows you how it can make your JavaScript code even better.</p></div>

Intended for developers who are already familiar with the Apex language, and experienced Java and C# developers who are moving to Apex, this book starts where the Force.com documentation leaves off.</p>   <p>Instead of trying to cover all of the features of the platform, Advanced Apex programming focuses entirely on the Apex language and core design patterns. You’ll learn how to truly think in Apex – to embrace limits and bulk patterns. You’ll see how to develop architectures for efficient and reliable trigger handling, and for asynchronous operations. You’ll discover that best practices differ radically depending on whether you are building software for a specific organization or for a managed package. And you’ll find approaches for incorporating testing and diagnostic code that can dramatically improve the reliability and deployment of Apex software, and reduce your lifecycle and support costs.</p>   <p>Based on his experience as a consultant, Salesforce MVP and architect of major AppExchange packages, Dan Appleman focuses on the real-world problems and issues that are faced by Apex developers every day, along with the obscure problems and surprises that can sneak up on you if you are unprepared.</p>  <p>This third edition contains updates through Summer 15 (API 34) along with significant new content on asynchronous design patterns, optimization and maintaining Apex applications.</p></div>

Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ (5th Edition)|David J. Barnes|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51gvMHguRmL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <i> <b>Objects First with Java: A Practical Introduction Using BlueJ, 5e,</b> </i>is ideal for introductory courses in Java/Introduction to Programming and Object-Oriented Programming and for beginning programmers.<br> <br>This is the only introductory programming textbook that uses the BlueJ integrated development environment (IDE) to teach introductory and object-oriented programming principles using Java. Its close integration with the BlueJ development environment allows this book to focus on key aspects of object-oriented software development from day one. BlueJ's clear visualization of classes and objects means that readers can immediately appreciate the differences between them, and gain a much better understanding of the nature of an object than they would from simply reading source code. Unlike traditional textbooks, the chapters are not ordered by language features but by software development concepts. Language features are introduced as a response to the problems to be solved. A large number of different, interesting projects are used to provide variety and avoid the monotony of a running problem. This book takes an “objects first” approach to teaching the traditionally difficult concepts of objects in a manipulative visual form. Throughout, the emphasis is on developing a practical approach to programming, with students encouraged to add code to existing programs rather than working with an intimidating sheet of blank paper. This textbook is printed in four-color to aid pedagogy and reader learning.<br> <br> </div>

First, you'll get a detailed introduction to Python and to programming. You'll find out exactly what happens when your programs are executed. Through real-world examples, you'll learn how to work with numbers, text, big data sets, and files. Then you'll see how to create and use your own data types.<br><br>The incremental examples show you the steps and missteps that happen while developing programs, so you know what to expect when you tackle a problem on your own. Inspired by ""How to Design Programs"" (HtDP), you'll learn a six-step recipe for designing functions, which helps you as you start to learn the concepts--and becomes an integral part of writing programs by the end.<br><br>As you learn to use the fundamental programming tools in the first half of the book, you'll see how to document and organize your code so that you and other programmers can more easily read and understand it. Beyond the basics, you'll learn how to ensure that your programs are reliable, and how to work with databases, download data from the web automatically, and build user interfaces.

Mastering Algorithms with C: Useful Techniques from Sorting to Encryption|Kyle Loudon|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sqhxuhuQL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <div> There are many books on data structures and algorithms, including some with useful libraries of C functions. <i>Mastering Algorithms with C</i> offers you a unique combination of theoretical background and working code. With robust solutions for everyday programming tasks, this book avoids the abstract style of most classic data structures and algorithms texts, but still provides all of the information you need to understand the purpose and use of common programming techniques. Implementations, as well as interesting, real-world examples of each data structure and algorithm, are included. Using both a programming style and a writing style that are exceptionally clean, Kyle Loudon shows you how to use such essential data structures as lists, stacks, queues, sets, trees, heaps, priority queues, and graphs. He explains how to use algorithms for sorting, searching, numerical analysis, data compression, data encryption, common graph problems, and computational geometry. And he describes the relative efficiency of all implementations. The compression and encryption chapters not only give you working code for reasonably efficient solutions, they offer explanations of concepts in an approachable manner for people who never have had the time or expertise to study them in depth. Anyone with a basic understanding of the C language can use this book. In order to provide maintainable and extendible code, an extra level of abstraction (such as pointers to functions) is used in examples where appropriate. Understanding that these techniques may be unfamiliar to some programmers, Loudon explains them clearly in the introductory chapters.

Murach's Oracle SQL and PL/SQL for Developers, 2nd Edition|Joel Murach|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51PlbZV16VL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>If you're developing applications that access Oracle databases, you can save time and work by having SQL do more of the data handling for you: This new book shows you how. It teaches you how to create effective SQL queries to extract and update the data in an Oracle database. It teaches you how to design and implement a database, giving you insight into performance and security issues. It teaches you how to use PL/SQL to take advantage of powerful features like stored procedures, functions, and triggers. In short, it teaches you to create the kind of efficient database applications that make you a more effective and valuable developer.</p><p></p><h4>Here are 5 of the ways that our book differs from the others</h4><p><b>#1: You'll see how to take advantage of the Oracle SQL Developer tool</b></p><p>SQL Developer is a free tool for working with database objects and SQL statements. Its graphical interface makes it more intuitive and easier to use than older command-line tools like SQL*Plus. I think you'll find it boosts your productivity as you use it to write and run queries, to work with database objects, or to debug stored procedures.</p><p><b>#2: You'll start off with how to query a database, not how to design one</b></p><p>This book is written for application developers, and the first thing an application developer needs to know is how to write queries. So that's what's covered in the first 8 chapters of this book. It starts with simple queries, then moves on to complex inner and outer joins, summary queries, and subqueries that do more of the database processing so that your applications can do less.</p><p>Once you're comfortable with querying databases, this book shows how to design a database and how to create database tables. Having this background can help you query a database more effectively. And it provides a solid introduction to DBA skills if you're interested in that career path.</p><p><b>#3: You get 2 books in 1: A SQL book and a PL/SQL book</b></p><p>PL/SQL allows you to write complex scripts, stored procedures, functions, and triggers, all essential skills for most application developers. So along with SQL, this book covers the PL/SQL that you'll use most of the time; there's no need to buy a second book to learn PL/SQL.</p><p><b>#4: Complete applications show you how all the pieces interact</b></p><p>One key to mastering SQL is to have plenty of coding examples that show how the features you re learning work and what problems you may run into as you use them on your own. So this book provides dozens of SQL statements and PL/SQL scripts for various jobs that are routine in business applications. Download the examples for free from our website and use them as starting points for your own SQL routines.</p><p><b>#5: The paired-pages format lets you set your own pace</b></p><p>Depending on what you already know about Oracle SQL and how fast you want to go, you can read every page and study each example...skim through the headings for topics you don't know...scan through the righthand pages for development details you might have missed in the past...or turn to any two-page spread when you need reference information. The paired-pages format makes it easy and fast for you to use the book the way you want to.</p><p>(If you aren't familiar with how the paired pages work, please be sure to download a sample chapter from our website)</p></div>

Now, two of the world's most respected C++ experts distill the rich collective experience of the global C++ community into a set of coding standards that every developer and development team can understand and use as a basis for their own coding standards. </p> <p>The authors cover virtually every facet of C++ programming: design and coding style, functions, operators, class design, inheritance, construction/destruction, copying, assignment, namespaces, modules, templates, genericity, exceptions, STL containers and algorithms, and more. Each standard is described concisely, with practical examples. From type definition to error handling, this book presents C++ best practices, including some that have only recently been identified and standardized-techniques you may not know even if you've used C++ for years. Along the way, you'll find answers to questions like </p> <ul> <li>What's worth standardizing--and what isn't? </li> </ul> <ul> <li>What are the best ways to code for scalability?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>What are the elements of a rational error handling policy? </li> </ul> <ul> <li>How (and why) do you avoid unnecessary initialization, cyclic, and definitional dependencies?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When (and how) should you use static and dynamic polymorphism together?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>How do you practice ""safe"" overriding?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>When should you provide a no-fail swap? </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why and how should you prevent exceptions from propagating across module boundaries?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why shouldn't you write namespace declarations or directives in a header file?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Why should you use STL vector and string instead of arrays?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>How do you choose the right STL search or sort algorithm?</li> </ul> <ul> <li>What rules should you follow to ensure type-safe code?</li> </ul> <p>Whether you're working alone or with others, <i> <b>C++ Coding Standards</b> </i> will help you write cleaner code--and write it faster, with fewer hassles and less frustration.</p> <br> <br></div>"

Mastering Oracle SQL, 2nd Edition|Sanjay Mishra|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518Iiugsf%2BL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>The vast majority of Oracle SQL books discuss some syntax, provide the barest rudiments of using Oracle SQL, and perhaps include a few simple examples. It might be enough to pass a survey course, or give you some buzz words to drop in conversation with real Oracle DBAs. But if you use Oracle SQL on a regular basis, you want much more. You want to access the full power of SQL to write queries in an Oracle environment. You want a solid understanding of what's possible with Oracle SQL, creative techniques for writing effective and accurate queries, and the practical, hands-on information that leads to true mastery of the language. Simply put, you want useful, expert best practices that can be put to work immediately, not just non-vendor specific overview or theory.Updated to cover the latest version of Oracle, Oracle 10g, this edition of the highly regarded <i>Mastering Oracle SQL</i> has a stronger focus on technique and on Oracle's implementation of SQL than any other book on the market. It covers Oracle s vast library of built-in functions, the full range of Oracle SQL query-writing features, regular expression support, new aggregate and analytic functions, subqueries in the SELECT and WITH clauses, multiset union operators, enhanced support for hierarchical queries: leaf and loop detection, and the CONNECT_BY_ROOT operator, new partitioning methods (some introduced in Oracle9i Release 2), and the native XML datatype, XMLType.<i>Mastering Oracle SQL</i>, 2nd Edition fills the gap between the sometimes spotty vendor documentation, and other books on SQL that just don't explore the full depth of what is possible with Oracle-specific SQL. For those who want to harness the untapped (and often overlooked) power of Oracle SQL, this essential guide for putting Oracle SQL to work will prove invaluable.</p></div>

Organized into 16 chapters, the book provides examples to illustrate the use of Semantic Web technologies in solving common modeling problems. It uses the life and works of William Shakespeare to demonstrate some of the most basic capabilities of the Semantic Web.  <br>The book first provides an overview of the Semantic Web and aspects of the Web. It then discusses semantic modeling and how it can support the development from chaotic information gathering to one characterized by information sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. It also explains the use of RDF to implement the Semantic Web by allowing information to be distributed over the Web, along with the use of SPARQL to access RDF data. Moreover, the reader is introduced to components that make up a Semantic Web deployment and how they fit together, the concept of inferencing in the Semantic Web, and how RDFS differs from other schema languages. Finally, the book considers the use of SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) to manage vocabularies by taking advantage of the inferencing structure of RDFS-Plus.  <br>This book is intended for the working ontologist who is trying to create a domain model on the Semantic Web.<ul><li>Updated with the latest developments and advances in Semantic Web technologies for organizing, querying, and processing information, including SPARQL, RDF and RDFS, OWL 2.0, and SKOS </li><li>Detailed information on the ontologies used in today's key web applications, including ecommerce, social networking, data mining, using government data, and more </li><li>Even more illustrative examples and case studies that demonstrate what semantic technologies are and how they work together to solve real-world problems</li></ul></div>

When designers and artists learn the basics of writing software, they develop a new form of literacy that enables them to create new media for the present, and to imagine future media that are beyond the capacities of current software tools. This book introduces this new literacy by teaching computer programming within the context of the visual arts. It offers a comprehensive reference and text for Processing (www.processing.org), an open-source programming language that can be used by students, artists, designers, architects, researchers, and anyone who wants to program images, animation, and interactivity. Written by Processing's cofounders, the book offers a definitive reference for students and professionals. Tutorial chapters make up the bulk of the book; advanced professional projects from such domains as animation, performance, and installation are discussed in interviews with their creators.</p><p>This second edition has been thoroughly updated. It is the first book to offer in-depth coverage of Processing 2.0 and 3.0, and all examples have been updated for the new syntax. Every chapter has been revised, and new chapters introduce new ways to work with data and geometry. New ""synthesis"" chapters offer discussion and worked examples of such topics as sketching with code, modularity, and algorithms. New interviews have been added that cover a wider range of projects. ""Extension"" chapters are now offered online so they can be updated to keep pace with technological developments in such fields as computer vision and electronics.</p><p><b>Interviews</b>SUE.C, Larry Cuba, Mark Hansen, Lynn Hershman Leeson, Jürg Lehni, LettError, Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman, Benjamin Maus, Manfred Mohr, Ash Nehru, Josh On, Bob Sabiston, Jennifer Steinkamp, Jared Tarbell, Steph Thirion, Robert Winter</p></div>"

Powershell: The Comprehensive Beginners Guide To Taking Control Of The Powershell Command Line|Miles Price|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51iUzCBo-QL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>PowerShell was first introduced in November 2006 and, since then has gone on to be improved with the result that we now have PowerShell 5.0. PowerShell is a programming language, object oriented like C and Python and an interactive command line shell that is designed to help automate certain system tasks and to create management tools for some of the more common processes. </p>  <p><b>Inside you will receive an overview of the PowerShell, how it works and what you can use it for, as well as a brief overview of the more helpful commands.</b> This should give you a firm footing in using PowerShell to make life more productive and easier.</p>  <p>It was designed by Microsoft to make it easier to automate tasks and to help make admin tasks a lot less tedious and far easier to solve. For example, PowerShell can be used to show you all of the computers on your network, or all of the USB devices you have. <i>You can also use it to carry out an admin task that takes a lot of time, having it running in the background while you get on with other stuff. </i></p>  <p>You can find processes that have stopped responding and kill them off or find particular information about a computer on the network and export that information in HTML format. <b>In short, the capabilities that PowerShell has have given you the ability to create scripts and put several commands together to automate those tasks that are repetitive and tedious.</b></p></div>

Refactoring to Patterns|Joshua Kerievsky|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/515omKbeNTL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> In 1994, DESIGN PATTERNS changed the landscape of object-oriented development by introducing classic Solutions to recurring design problems. In 1999, REFACTORING revolutionized design by introducing an effective process for improving code. With the highly-anticipated REFACTORING TO PATTERNS, Joshua Kerievsky has changed our approach to design by forever uniting patterns with the evolutionary process of refactoring. This book introduces the theory and practice of pattern-directed refactorings: sequences of low-level refactorings that allow designers to safely move designs to, towards, or away from pattern implementations. Using code from real-world projects, Kerievsky documents the thinking and steps underlying over two dozed pattern-based design transformations. Along the way he offers insights into pattern differences and how to implement patterns in the simplest possible ways.</div>

Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java (2nd Edition)|Mark Allen Weiss|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/411AHFNXC8L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p><b></b> Data Structures and Problem Solving Using Java, Second Edition, provides a practical introduction to data structures and algorithms from the perspective of abstract thinking and problem solving, as well as the use of Java. <b></b> Experienced author and educator Mark Allen Weiss takes a unique approach by clearly separating the specification and implementation of data structures. He presents the interface and running time of data structures in Part II of the book. Then, he provides the opportunity for readers to use the data structures in a variety of practical examples before introducing the implementations in Part IV. By first gaining a familiarity with the interfaces and uses of data structures, readers will be able to think more abstractly about the subject matter. New utilization of the Java 1.2 Collections API frees the second edition from relying upon a non-standard, book-dependent data structures package. The new edition also features new coverage of Design Patterns and significantly revised material of inheritance.<b></b> This book is appropriate for readers who are familiar with basic Java programming concepts or are new to the language and want to learn how it treats data structures concepts.  </p></div>

C# For Beginners: The tactical guidebook - Learn CSharp by coding|Jonas Fagerberg|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51qMULNvSYL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> This book is for <b>YOU </b>if you are a prospective C# programmer and like a <b>CHALLENGE</b>. This is not your run of the mill encyclopedic programming book; it is highly modularized, tactical and practical, meaning that you learn by reading theory and then implement targeted exercises.<br><br>One <b>big difference</b> from most of the other programming books out there, other than being highly modularized and tactical, is that you actually will implement graphical user interfaces in the form of Windows Forms (with a few exceptions) instead of boring text based Console applications. You will also create many small complete applications instead of one gigantic and overwhelming application or small examples taken out of context. Towards the end of the first part of the book when you have learned the basics of the C# language and object-oriented programming (OOP) you will implement a larger application from start to finish.<br><br>The book does not presuppose that you have any prior C# knowledge since the purpose of the book is to teach you just that. Even if you already have created a couple of small C# projects on your own or have been developing applications for a while you might find the content in this book useful as a refresher. <br><br>The first part describes the fundamentals of the C# language such as variables, loops and methods. The book then gets progressively more challenging, describing, among other things, object oriented programming, generics, multithreading, asynchronous operations and reflection. The content is tactical, practical and highly modular to make it easier for you to learn. This mean that you actually have to read and implement the exercises in order to learn everything the book teaches. It is not recommended that you only read the book conceptually from cover to cover; the best way to learn is to be tactical and actually implement the practical exercises after reading each chapter.<br><br>If you are aspiring to take the Microsoft exam 70-483 this book can be a great complement to the more traditional encyclopedic books on the market in that it contains many complete examples and exercises that you can implement to deepen your understanding of C#. The author has worked professionally with C# since it was released and as a Microsoft Certified Instructor for a number of years teaching C#, Visual Basic.NET and the .NET Framework. <br><br>I welcome you to challenge the teaching methodology of the book <b>after</b>  you have gone through and implemented <b>all</b> the examples in the book.

xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code|Gerard Meszaros|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/517GxwaFMvL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">Automated testing is a cornerstone of agile  development. An effective testing strategy will deliver new  functionality more aggressively, accelerate user feedback, and improve  quality. However, for many developers, creating effective automated  tests is a unique and unfamiliar challenge.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;""> <b> <i>xUnit Test Patterns</i> </b>  is the definitive guide to writing automated tests using xUnit, the  most popular unit testing framework in use today. Agile coach and test  automation expert Gerard Meszaros describes 68 proven patterns for  making tests easier to write, understand, and maintain. He then shows  you how to make them more robust and repeatable--and far more  cost-effective.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">Loaded with information,  this book feels like three books in one. The first part is a detailed  tutorial on test automation that covers everything from test strategy  to in-depth test coding. The second part, a catalog of 18 frequently  encountered ""test smells,"" provides trouble-shooting guidelines to help  you determine the root cause of problems and the most applicable  patterns. The third part contains detailed descriptions of each  pattern, including refactoring instructions illustrated by extensive  code samples in multiple programming languages.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">Topics covered include</p> <ul> <li>Writing better tests--and writing them faster </li> <li>The four phases of automated tests: fixture setup, exercising the system under test, result verification, and fixture teardown </li> <li>Improving test coverage by isolating software from its environment using Test Stubs and Mock Objects </li> <li>Designing software for greater testability </li> <li>Using  test ""smells"" (including code smells, behavior smells, and project  smells) to spot problems and know when and how to eliminate them </li> <li>Refactoring tests for greater simplicity, robustness, and execution speed</li> </ul> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">This  book will benefit developers, managers, and testers working with any  agile or conventional development process, whether doing test-driven  development or writing the tests last. While the patterns and smells  are especially applicable to all members of the xUnit family, they also  apply to next-generation behavior-driven development frameworks such as  RSpec and JBehave and to other kinds of test automation tools,  including recorded test tools and data-driven test tools such as Fit  and FitNesse.<br> </p> <p style=""margin: 0px;""> <br> </p> <i>Visual Summary of the Pattern Language </i> <i> <br> Foreword </i> <i> <br> Preface </i> <i> <br> Acknowledgments </i> <i> <br> Introduction </i> <i> <br> Refactoring a Test </i> <br> PART I: The Narratives <br> Chapter 1 A Brief Tour<br> Chapter 2 Test Smells <br> Chapter 3 Goals of Test Automation <br> Chapter 4 Philosophy of Test Automation <br> Chapter 5 Principles of Test Automation <br> Chapter 6 Test Automation Strategy <br> Chapter 7 xUnit Basics <br> Chapter 8 Transient Fixture Management <br> Chapter 9 Persistent Fixture Management <br> Chapter 10 Result Verification <br> Chapter 11 Using Test Doubles <br> Chapter 12 Organizing Our Tests <br> Chapter 13 Testing with Databases <br> Chapter 14 A Roadmap to Effective Test Automation <br> PART II: The Test Smells  <br> Chapter 15 Code Smells <br> Chapter 16 Behavior Smells <br> Chapter 17 Project Smells <br> PART III: The Patterns  <br> Chapter 18 Test Strategy Patterns <br> Chapter 19 xUnit Basics Patterns <br> Chapter 20 Fixture Setup Patterns <br> Chapter 21 Result Verification Patterns <br> Chapter 22 Fixture Teardown Patterns <br> Chapter 23 Test Double Patterns <br> Chapter 24 Test Organization Patterns <br> Chapter 25 Database Patterns <br> Chapter 26 Design-for-Testability Patterns <br> Chapter 27 Value Patterns <br> PART IV: Appendixes <br> Appendix A Test Refactorings  <br> Appendix B xUnit Terminology  <br> Appendix C xUnit Family Members <br> Appendix D Tools <br> Appendix E Goals and Principles <br> Appendix F Smells, Aliases, and Causes <br> Appendix G Patterns, Aliases, and Variations <br> <i>Glossary </i> <i> <br> References </i> <i> <br> Index </i> <p style=""margin: 0px;""> <br> </p></div>"

Users with a basic understanding of Base SAS who are new to the SAS macro language will find more detail, utilities, and references to additional learning opportunities; advanced macro language programmers who need help with data-driven macros and dynamic application development will find greatly expanded treatment of these topics. <br></p><p> <br>This revised and enlarged edition includes the following topics: <br></p><ul> <br><li>New and expanded introduction to the macro language</li> <br><li>Functions, automatic macro variables, and macro statements new to the macro language</li> <br><li>Expanded macro language tools that interface with the operating system</li> <br><li>Expanded data-driven methodologies used to build dynamic applications</li> <br><li>Expanded discussion of list processing, with four alternative approaches presented</li> <br><li>Additional file and data management examples</li> <br><li>Expanded discussion of CALL EXECUTE and DOSUBL</li> <br><li>New discussion of using the macro language on remote servers</li> <br><li>Expanded discussion and examples of macro quoting</li> </ul> <br><p> <br>Far beyond a reference manual issued from an “ivory tower,” this book is pragmatic and example-driven: Yes, you will find syntax examples; yes, the code is explained. But the focus of this book is on actual code used to solve real-world business problems. In fact, an entire appendix is dedicated to listing the nearly 70 classes of problems that are solved by programs covered in this edition. Discussion of the examples elucidates the pros and cons of the particular solution and often suggests alternative approaches. Therefore, this book provides you both a compendium of reusable and adaptable code, and opportunities for deepening your understanding and growing as a SAS programmer.</p></div>

Christian Albright|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Zctf91sLL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Chris Albright's VBA FOR MODELERS, 4TH EDITION is an essential tool for helping you learn to use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as a means to automate common spreadsheet tasks, as well as to create sophisticated management science applications. VBA is the programming language for Microsoft Office.  VBA FOR MODELERS contains two parts. The first part teaches the essentials of VBA for Excel. The second part illustrates how a number of management science models can be automated with VBA. From a user's standpoint, these applications hide the details of the management science techniques and instead present a simple user interface for inputs and results.</div>
Elements of Programming|Alexander A. Stepanov|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415clOnBntL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> “Ask a mechanical, structural, or electrical engineer how far they would get without a heavy reliance on a firm mathematical foundation, and they will tell you, ‘not far.’ Yet so-called software engineers often practice their art with little or no idea of the mathematical underpinnings of what they are doing. And then we wonder why software is notorious for being delivered late and full of bugs, while other engineers routinely deliver finished bridges, automobiles, electrical appliances, etc., on time and with only minor defects. This book sets out to redress this imbalance. Members of my advanced development team at Adobe who took the course based on the same material all benefited greatly from the time invested. It may appear as a highly technical text intended only for computer scientists, but it should be required reading for all practicing software engineers.”<br>    —Martin Newell, Adobe Fellow<br> <br> “The book contains some of the most beautiful code I have ever seen.”<br>    —Bjarne Stroustrup, Designer of C++ <br> <br>“I am happy to see the content of Alex’s course, the development and teaching of which I strongly supported as the CTO of Silicon Graphics, now available to all programmers in this elegant little book.”<br>    —Forest Baskett, General Partner, New Enterprise Associates<br> <br>“Paul’s patience and architectural experience helped to organize Alex’s  mathematical approach into a tightly-structured edifice—an impressive feat!”<br>    —Robert W. Taylor, Founder of Xerox PARC CSL and DEC Systems Research Center<br> <br> <b> <i>Elements of Programming</i> </b>provides a different understanding of programming than is presented elsewhere. Its major premise is that practical programming, like other areas of science and engineering,must be based on a solid mathematical foundation. The book shows that algorithms implemented in a real programming language, such as C++, can operate in the most general mathematical setting. For example, the fast exponentiation  algorithm is defined to work with any associative operation. Using abstract algorithms leads to efficient, reliable, secure, and economical software.<br> <br>This is not an easy book. Nor is it a compilation of tips and tricks for incremental improvements in your programming skills. The book’s value is more fundamental and, ultimately, more critical for insight into programming. To benefit fully, you will need to work through it from beginning to end, reading the code, proving the lemmas, and doing the exercises. When finished, you will see how the application of the deductive method to your programs assures that your system’s software components will work together and behave as they must.<br> <br>The book presents a number of algorithms and requirements for types on which they are defined. The code for these descriptions—also available on the Web—is written in a small subset of C++ meant to be accessible to any experienced programmer. This subset is defined in a special language appendix coauthored by Sean Parent and Bjarne Stroustrup.<br> <br>Whether you are a software developer, or any other professional for whom programming is an important activity, or a committed student, you will come to understand what the book’s experienced authors have been teaching and demonstrating for years—that mathematics is good for programming, and that theory is good for practice.<br> <br></div>

Access 2010 Pure SQL: Real Power-packed solutions for business users, developers, and the rest of us|Dr. Pindaro Epaminonda Demertzoglou (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61V0ni1iL6L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> This book is the next version of the very popular ""Pure SQL"" series from AlphaPress. As always, the primary goal of the book is to provide the database professional with solutions to problems in everyday business situations.   For this purpose, the author is following user newsgroups for years where multiple business problems are posted.  That is why all the solutions in the book are business related and most often answers to actual problems faced by professionals.  The second goal of this book is to help people who want to learn SQL from the ground up.  For this reason the author included in the beginning of each chapter some simple but not simplistic examples so that the novice can be gradually introduced to the concepts of SQL and become an expert. If you need to teach Access SQL in a class environment, you might want to consider the book ""Access SQL Comprehensive: version 2010"" from the same author.     Access 2010 Pure SQL is not a book from a smarty to smarties.  It is a pragmatic book that will save you time by giving you answers to common business scenarios.  For instance, it will explain to you very well what referential integrity is, how we use it, and why it is important for business.  It will explain cross-tabbing  and its significance for business analytical tasks.  However, the book will not bother with teaching you relational algebra and the connection to SQL; it is not intended to waste a second from your time.</div>"

Understanding HTTP is essential for practically all web-based programming, design, analysis, and administration.While the basics of HTTP are elegantly simple, the protocol's advanced features are notoriously confusing, because they knit together complex technologies and terminology from many disciplines.  This book clearly explains HTTP and these interrelated core technologies, in twenty-one logically organized chapters, backed up by hundreds of detailed illustrations and examples, and convenient reference appendices.  <i>HTTP: The Definitive Guide</i> explains everything people need to use HTTP efficiently -- including the ""black arts"" and ""tricks of the trade"" -- in a concise and readable manner.In addition to explaining the basic HTTP features, syntax and guidelines, this book clarifies related, but often misunderstood topics, such as: TCP connection management, web proxy and cache architectures, web robots and robots.txt files, Basic and Digest authentication, secure HTTP transactions, entity body processing, internationalized content, and traffic redirection.Many technical professionals will benefit from this book.  Internet architects and developers who need to design and develop software, IT professionals who need to understand Internet architectural components and interactions, multimedia designers who need to publish and host multimedia, performance engineers who need to optimize web performance, technical marketing professionals who need a clear picture of core web architectures and protocols, as well as untold numbers of students and hobbyists will all benefit from the knowledge packed in this volume.There are many books that explain how to use the Web, but this is the one that explains how the Web works.  Written by experts with years of design and implementation experience, this book is the definitive technical bible that describes the ""why"" and the ""how"" of HTTP and web core technologies.  <i>HTTP: The Definitive Guide</i> is an essential reference that no technically-inclined member of the Internet community should be without.</p></div>"

At the heart of the book is the Deitel app-driven approach–concepts are presented in the context of complete working Android apps, rather than using code snippets. The introduction and app test drives at the beginning of each chapter show one or more sample executions. The book’s source code is available at http://www.deitel.com/books/AndroidFP3. </p> <p style=""margin:0px;""> </p> <p style=""margin:0px;"">The apps in this book were carefully designed to introduce you to key Android features and APIs. You’ll quickly learn everything you need to start building Android apps–beginning with a test-drive of the Tip Calculator app in Chapter 1, then building one new app in each of Chapters 2 through 9. By the time you reach Chapter 10, you’ll be ready to create your own apps for submission to Google Play and other app marketplaces. You’ll master the Google Play submission process, including uploading your apps. You’ll decide whether to sell your apps or offer them for free, and learn how to market them via social media and monetize them with in-app advertising, in-app billing, virtual goods and more.</p> <p style=""margin:0px;""> </p></div>"

By learning assembly language programming, you learn how the machine really operates and that knowledge will help you write better high-level language code. A dirty little secret assembly language programmers rarely admit to, however, is that what you really need to learn is machine organization, not assembly language programming. Write Great Code Vol I, the first in a series from assembly language expert Randall Hyde, dives right into machine organization without the extra overhead of learning assembly language programming at the same time. And since Write Great Code Vol I concentrates on the machine organization, not assembly language, the reader will learn in greater depth those subjects that are language-independent and of concern to a high level language programmer. Write Great Code Vol I will help programmers make wiser choices with respect to programming statements and data types when writing software, no matter which language they use.</p></div>"

While most C programmers use APIs and the libraries that implement them in almost every application they write, relatively few programmers create and disseminate new, widely applicable APIs. C Interfaces and Implementations shows how to create reusable APIs using interface-based design, a language-independent methodology that separates interfaces from their implementations. This methodology is explained by example. The author describes in detail 24 interfaces and their implementations, providing the reader with a thorough understanding of this design approach. Features of C Interfaces and Implementations: * Concise interface descriptions that comprise a reference manual for programmers interested in using the interfaces. * A guided tour of the code that implements each chapters interface tp help those modifying or extending an interface or designing related interfaces. * In-depth focus on algorithm engineering: how to packag</div>

The Cathedral & the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary|Eric S. Raymond|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JvHerdfdL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p>""This is how we did it."" --Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernelIt all started with a series of odd statistics. The leading challenger to Microsoft's stranglehold on the computer industry is an operating system called Linux, the product of thousands of volunteer programmers who collaborate over the Internet. The software behind a majority of all the world's web sites doesn't come from a big company either, but from a loosely coordinated group of volunteer programmers called the Apache Group. The Internet itself, and much of its core software, was developed through a process of networked collaboration.The key to these stunning successes is a movement that has come to be called open source, because it depends on the ability of programmers to freely share their program source code so that others can improve it. In 1997, Eric S. Raymond outlined the core principles of this movement in a manifesto called ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar,"" which was published and freely redistributed over the Internet.Mr. Raymond's thinking electrified the computer industry. He argues that the development of the Linux operating system by a loose confederation of thousands of programmers--without central project management or control--turns on its head everything we thought we knew about software project management. Internet-enabled collaboration and free information sharing, not monopolistic control, is the key to innovation and product quality.This idea was interesting to more than programmers and software project leaders. It suggested a whole new way of doing business, and the possibility of unprecedented shifts in the power structures of the computer industry.The rush to capitalize on the idea of open source started with Netscape's decision to release its flagship Netscape Navigator product under open source licensing terms in early 1998. Before long, Fortune 500 companies like Intel, IBM, and Oracle were joining the party. By August 1999, when the leading Linux distributor, Red Hat Software, made its hugely successful public stock offering, it had become clear that open source was ""the next big thing"" in the computer industry.This revolutionary book starts out with ""A Brief History of Hackerdom""--the historical roots of the open-source movement--and details the events that led to the recognition of the power of open source. It contains the full text of ""The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar,"" updated and expanded for this book, plus Mr. Raymond's other key essays on the social and economic dynamics of open source software development.Open source is the competitive advantage in the Internet Age. <i>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</i> is a must for anyone who cares about the computer industry or the dynamics of the information economy. Already, billions of dollars have been made and lost based on the ideas in this book. Its conclusions will be studied, debated, and implemented for years to come.</p></div>"

SurviveJS - Webpack: From apprentice to master|Mr Juho Tuomas Vepsäläinen|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4147Mk6k4%2BL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p>Webpack, a module bundler, is a powerful tool that helps you to develop complex web applications. ""SurviveJS - Webpack"" is meant for beginner to intermediate users of the tool wanting to understand webpack better.</p>    <p>You will develop a complex configuration in the book tutorial while covering different facets of webpack. In addition, the 45 short chapters and seven appendices work as a reference.</p>    <p>Even though the book has been designed around webpack, many of the techniques covered go beyond it. You will learn to improve the quality of your code while becoming aware of optimization techniques that help you to deliver more performant web applications.</p>    <p>The book was developed in collaboration with the webpack community, and its structure has evolved accordingly. A third of royalties go to Tobias Koppers, the author of the tool. The writer is a core developer of webpack so by purchasing this book you will support the effort in multiple ways.</p>    <h2>Testimonials</h2>    <ul>  <li>After weeks failing at configuring webpack, I stumbled upon SurviveJS book while looking for yet another tutorial. Since that day, it has been my go-to resource for every single webpack question I ever had. - Clément Paris, Front-end engineer</li>  <li>Brilliant! A must have if you want to to learn webpack but also if need an updated reference guide. I always use it as a reference guide when I develop. - Andrea Chiumenti, CEO, Red Software Systems</li>  <li>Before I worked through the SurviveJS webpack book, my own webpack config, cobbled together from random code on the Internet, was a mystery to me. Afterwards, I have route-splitting and parallel-loading superpowers. - Gavin Doughtie, Senior Software Engineer, Google</li>  <li>Webpack is powerful but configuring it can be painful. Same goes with React. There are so many ways of configuring React with asset compilation, minification etc that it is easy to get lost. This book provides practical tips on how to proceed. - Neeraj Singh, Founder, Big Binary</li>  <li>This guide was a great starter in taming the Wild West of ESNext-era JavaScript development. Its beauty comes from its commitment to not skipping the fundamentals in favor of a fast demo, but making sure you're understanding what you're doing as you bootstrap your next JavaScript-based UI project. - Aaron Harris, Software Engineer</li>  <li>This guide is a great way to get started with webpack or improve your existing skills. After a detailed introduction, you'll start working on a webpack project that provides all you need to push your app to production. Highly recommended. - Julien Castelain, Software Engineer, Liferay</li>  </ul>    <h2>About Author</h2>    <p>Juho Vepsäläinen is behind the SurviveJS effort, and he is a core member of webpack. In addition to Reactabular, a table library, he has been active in the open source scene for a decade, and his past includes projects like Blender.</p></div>"

The Standard C Library|P.J. Plauger|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71V7SAN29EL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.gif|<div> <p>Prentice Hall's most important C programming title in years.  A companion volume to Kernighan &amp; Ritchie's C PROGRAMMING  LANGUAGE. A collection of reusable functions (code for  building data structures, code for performing math functions  and scientific calculations, etc.) which will save C  programmers time and money especially when working on large  programming projects. The C Library is part of the ANSI  (American National Standard Institute) for the C Language.  This new book contains the complete code for the library. It  covers elements of the library with which even the most  experienced C programmers are not familiar such as  internationalization (the ability to write programs that can  adapt to different cultural locales, for example, using the C  library, programmers can write software that manipulates  large character sets such as Kanji). Structured like the  Standard C Library, it contains 15 headers declaring or  defining all of the names in the library. A separate chapter  covers each header, including excerpts from relevant portions  of the C Standard showing all codes needed to implement each  portion of the library and explaining why it is necessary.  The book teaches readers the concepts and design issues  associated with library building. Using this book,  programemrs will be less likely to re-code something that  already exists in a given program. Plauger is one of the  world's leading experts on C and the C Library.                </p></div>

Practical C Programming: Why Does 2+2 = 5986? (Nutshell Handbooks)|Steve Oualline|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ckFJCRh5L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <div><p>There are lots of introductory C books, but this is the first one that has the no-nonsense, practical approach that has made Nutshell Handbooks® famous.C programming is more than just getting the syntax right. Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&amp;&amp; comes before || comes before ?:). The practical programmer reduces these to two:</p><ul><li>Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction.</li></ul>Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's  code.  This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses  of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art  of going through someone else's code, is described.This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments  on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and  features in the language.</div></div>"

Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science|John Zelle (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Jbi2BlgEL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python.   Although Python is the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages are avoided. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing.</div>

Learning XML, Second Edition|Erik T. Ray|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51RT7H4bYRL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>This second edition of the bestselling <i>Learning XML</i> provides web developers with a concise but grounded understanding of XML (the Extensible Markup Language) and its potential-- not just a whirlwind tour of XML.The author explains the important and relevant XML technologies and their capabilities clearly and succinctly with plenty of real-life projects and useful examples. He outlines the elements of markup--demystifying concepts such as attributes, entities, and namespaces--and provides enough depth and examples to get started.  <i>Learning XML</i> is a reliable source for anyone who needs to know XML, but doesn't want to waste time wading through hundreds of web sites or 800 pages of bloated text.For writers producing XML documents, this book clarifies files and the process of creating them with the appropriate structure and format. Designers will learn what parts of XML are most helpful to their team and will get started on creating Document Type Definitions. For programmers, the book makes syntax and structures clear. <i>Learning XML</i>  also discusses the stylesheets needed for viewing documents in the next generation of browsers, databases, and other devices.<i>Learning XML</i> illustrates the core XML concepts and language syntax, in addition to important related tools such as the CSS and XSL styling languages and the XLink and XPointer specifications for creating rich link structures. It includes information about three schema languages for validation: W3C Schema, Schematron, and RELAX-NG, which are gaining widespread support from people who need to validate documents but aren't satisfied with DTDs. Also new in this edition is a chapter on XSL-FO, a powerful formatting language for XML. If you need to wade through the acronym soup of XML and start to really use this powerful tool, <i>Learning XML</i>, will give you the roadmap you need.</p></div>

Beginning SQL 2012 Joes 2 Pros Volume 1: The SQL Queries 2012 Hands-On Tutorial for Beginners (SQL Exam Prep Series 70-461 Volume 1 Of 5)|Pinal Dave|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51fNpe6tjML._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> Finally a book for the true SQL Server beginner! Whether you are brand new to data bases and are thinking of getting your 70-461 certification or already a semi-pro working in the field and need some fingertip support, this is this is the book for you. Joes 2 Pros does not assume you already know anything about data bases or SQL server. The Author, Rick Morelan, started out as a true beginner after he decided he had had enough of working on a fishing boat in Alaska. Rick struggled for years to acquire the knowledge necessary just to get his foot in the door. Many years later as an instructor, who was not happy with the instructional material available for his SQL students, he began the process of creating his own material. In 2009 Rick released his first book, ""Beginning SQL Joes 2 Pros: The SQL Hands-On Guide for Beginners"" for SQL 2008. Due to its clear writing style, easy to follow images and free downloadable labs it quickly became a top seller on Amazon. This book builds on the success of the previous series and will help anyone transform themselves from a beginner ""Joe"" into a SQL 2012 ""Pro"". For those of you who have read the 2008 series for the 70-433 Exam you will find a lot of the same material from the SQL 2008 book in this SQL 2012 book. This is because much of the 70-461 test covers the same material as the 70-433. I have added material that is new to the test and removed material that is no longer relevant. If you have already read this series or have already passed the 70-433 exam you may choose to read my book which covers only the changes from 70-433 to 70-461 entitled ""Joes 2 Pros SQL 2012 Queries 70-461 Exam for SQL 2008 Pros"".</div>"

Akka is a distributed computing toolkit that uses the abstraction of the Actor model, enabling developers to build correct, concurrent, and distributed applications using Java and Scala with ease. </p><p>The book begins with a quick introduction that simplifies concurrent programming with actors. We then proceed to master all aspects of domain-driven design. We ll teach you how to scale out with Akka Remoting/Clustering. Finally, we introduce Conductr as a means to deploy to and manage microservices across a cluster.</p><h4>What you will learn</h4><ul><li>Use Akka actors to enable parallel execution</li><li>Build out domain-driven design based components like entities and aggregates</li><li>Respond to command requests on that aggregate root that affect the internal state</li><li>Leverage Akka Persistence, protobuf and Cassandra to save the persistent state of you entities</li><li>Build out complex processing graphs with the Graph Builder DSL</li><li>Understand the dynamic push/pull nature of backpressure handling within Akka Streams</li><li>Route HTTP requests to an actor and return a response</li><li>Deploy actor instances across a set of nodes via Conductr for high availability</li></ul><h4>About the Author</h4><p><b>Christian Baxter</b>, from an early age, has always had an interest in understanding how things worked. Growing up, he loved challenges and liked to tinker with and fix things. This inquisitive nature was the driving force that eventually led him into computer programming. While his primary focus in college was life sciences, he always set aside time to study computers and to explore all aspects of computer programming. When he graduated from college during the height of the Internet boom, he taught himself the necessary skills to get a job as a programmer. He s been happily programming ever since, working across diverse industries such as insurance, travel, recruiting, and advertising. He loves building out high-performance distributed systems using Scala on the Akka platform.</p><p>Christian was a long time Java programmer before making the switch over to Scala in 2010. He was looking for new technologies to build out high throughput and asynchronous systems and loved what he saw from Scala and Akka. Since then, he's been a major advocate for Akka, getting multiple ad tech companies he s worked for to adopt it as a means of building out reactive applications. He's also been an occasional contributor to the Akka codebase, identifying and helping to fix issues. When he s not hacking away on Scala and Akka, you can usually find him answering questions on Stackoverflow as cmbaxter.</p><h4>Table of Contents</h4><ol><li>Building a Better Reactive App</li><li>Simplifying Concurrent Programming with Actors</li><li>Curing Anemic Models with Domain-Driven Design</li><li>Making History with Event Sourcing</li><li>Separating Concerns with CQRS</li><li>Going with the Flow with Akka Streams</li><li>REST Easy with Akka HTTP</li><li>Scaling Out with Akka Remoting/Clustering</li><li>Managing Deployments with ConductR</li><li>Troubleshooting and Best Practices</li></ol></div>

The authors' enthusiasm for their subject is compelling as they present abstract concepts in a humorous and easy-to-grasp fashion. Together, these books will open new doors of thought to anyone who wants to find out what computing is really about.  <i>The Little Schemer </i>introduces computing as an extension of arithmetic and algebra; things that everyone studies in grade school and high school. It introduces programs as recursive functions and briefly discusses the limits of what computers can do. The authors use the programming language Scheme, and interesting foods to illustrate these abstract ideas.  <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> informs the reader about additional dimensions of computing: functions as values, change of state, and exceptional cases.  <i>The Little LISPer </i>has been a popular introduction to LISP for many years. It had appeared in French and Japanese.  <i>The Little Schemer </i>and  <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> are worthy successors and will prove equally popular as textbooks for Scheme courses as well as companion texts for any complete introductory course in Computer Science. </p></div>"

Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World (Pragmatic Programmers)|Joe Armstrong|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41IbWEBsjbL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>A multi-user game, web site, cloud application, or networked database can have thousands of users all interacting at the same time. You need a powerful, industrial-strength tool to handle the really hard problems inherent in parallel, concurrent environments.  You need Erlang. In this second edition of the bestselling <i>Programming Erlang</i>, you'll learn how to write parallel programs that scale effortlessly on multicore systems.<br><br>Using Erlang, you'll be surprised at how easy it becomes to deal with parallel problems, and how much faster and more efficiently your programs run. That's because Erlang uses <i>sets of parallel processes</i>-not a single sequential process, as found in most programming languages. <br><br>Joe Armstrong, creator of Erlang, introduces this powerful language in small steps, giving you a complete overview of Erlang and how to use it in common scenarios. You'll start with sequential programming, move to parallel programming and handling errors in parallel programs, and learn to work confidently with distributed programming and the standard Erlang/Open Telecom Platform (OTP) frameworks. <br><br>You need no previous knowledge of functional or parallel programming. The chapters are packed with hands-on, real-world tutorial examples and insider tips and advice, and finish with exercises for both beginning and advanced users.<br><br>The second edition has been extensively rewritten.  New to this edition are seven chapters covering the latest Erlang features: maps, the type system and the Dialyzer, WebSockets, programming idioms, and a new stand-alone execution environment. You'll write programs that dynamically  detect and correct errors, and that can be upgraded without stopping the system. There's also coverage of rebar (the de facto Erlang build system), and information on how to share and use Erlang projects on github, illustrated with examples from cowboy and bitcask.<br><br>Erlang will change your view of the world, and of how you program.<br><br><b> What You Need</b><br><br>The Erlang/OTP system.

SQL Server Execution Plans|Grant Fritchey|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41zMr4zoRzL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Every day, out in the various online forums devoted to SQL Server, and on Twitter, the same types of questions come up repeatedly: Why is this query running slowly? Why is SQL Server ignoring my index? Why does this query run quickly sometimes and slowly at others? My response is the same in each case: have you looked at the execution plan?  An execution plan describes what's going on behind the scenes when SQL Server executes a query. It shows how the query optimizer joined the data from the various tables defined in the query, which indexes it used, if any, how it performed any aggregations or sorting, and much more. It also estimates the cost of all of these operations, in terms of the relative load placed on the system.  Every Database Administrator, developer, report writer, and anyone else who writes T-SQL to access SQL Server data, must understand how to read and interpret execution plans. My book leads you right from the basics of capturing plans, through how to interrupt them in their various forms, graphical or XML, and then how to use the information you find there to diagnose the most common causes of poor query performance, and so optimize your SQL queries, and improve your indexing strategy.</div>

Real-Time C++: Efficient Object-Oriented and Template Microcontroller Programming|Christopher Michael Kormanyos|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41mg55JMb5L._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>The C++ language has powerful object-oriented and template features that can improve software design and portability while simultaneously reducing code complexity and the risk of error. Furthermore, C++ compiles highly efficient native code. This unique and effective combination makes C++ well-suited for programming microcontroller systems that require compact size, high performance and safety-critical reliability.</p><p>With this book, Chris Kormanyos delivers a highly practical guide to programming real-time embedded microcontroller systems in C++. It is divided into three parts plus several appendices. Part I provides a foundation for real-time C++ by covering language technologies, including object-oriented methods, template programming and optimization. Next, part II presents detailed descriptions of a variety of C++ components that are widely used in microcontroller programming. It details some of C++’s most powerful language elements, such as class types, templates and the STL, to develop components for microcontroller register access, low-level drivers, custom memory management, embedded containers, multitasking, etc.  Finally, part III describes mathematical methods and generic utilities that can be employed to solve recurring problems in real-time C++. The appendices include a brief C++ language tutorial, information on the real-time C++ development environment and instructions for building GNU GCC cross-compilers and a microcontroller circuit.</p><p>The most recent specification of C++11 in ISO/IEC 14882:2011 is used throughout the text. To facilitate portability, no libraries other than those specified in the language standard itself are used. Efficiency is always in focus and numerous examples are backed up with real-time performance measurements and size analyses that quantify the true costs of the code down to the very last byte and microsecond.</p><p>The target audience of this book mainly consists of students and professionals interested in real-time C++. Readers should be familiar with C or another programming language and will benefit most if they have had some previous experience with microcontroller electronics and the performance and size issues prevalent in embedded systems programming.</p></div>

Java For Testers: Learn Java fundamentals fast|Mr Alan J Richardson (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41eR6%2BPoOLL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> This book is for people who want to learn Java. Particularly people on a team that want to learn Java, but who aren't going to be coding the main Java application i.e. Testers, Managers, Business Analysts, Front End Developers, Designers, etc.  If you already know Java then this book may not be for you.  This book is aimed at beginners. Designed to help the reader get started fast, the book is easy to follow, and has examples related to testing.  You can find the companion web site for the book at http://javafortesters.com  The book covers 'just enough' to get people writing tests and abstraction layers. For example, the book cover the basics of Inheritance, but doesn't really cover Interfaces in detail. We explain the concept of Interfaces, because we need to know it to understand Collections, but not how to write them.  Why? Because the book covers enough to get you started, and working. But not overload the reader. Once you are on your way, and have gained some experience. You should have the basic knowledge to understand the additional concepts.  Why 'for testers'?  Java Developers coding production applications in Java need to learn Java differently from other people on the team.  Throughout the author's career, he has have written thousands of lines of Java code, but has rarely had to compile the code into an application. Yet, when we learn Java from most books, one of the first things we learn is 'javac' and the 'main' method and working from the command line. And this is confusing.  Most of the code the author writes is wrapped up in a JUnit @Test method.  The author has trained many people to write automation in Java, and everytime he has taught Java to testers or other people on the team, we start with a JUnit @Test method and run tests from the IDE.  Testers, and other people on the team use java differently. This book provides a different order and approach to learning Java.

The Joy of PHP: A Beginner's Guide to Programming Interactive Web Applications with PHP and mySQL|Alan Forbes|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51sfBlo5HFL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> Third Edition now with bonus chapters.  Have you ever wanted to design your own website or browser application but thought it would be too difficult or just didn't know where to start? Have you found the amount of information on the Internet either too daunting or not geared for your skill set or worse-- just plain boring? Are you interested in learning to program PHP and have some fun along the way? If so, then The Joy of PHP by Alan Forbes is the book for you!!    Alan starts with some basic HTML so the absolute beginner can catch up quickly and then goes step by step on how PHP works. You start with the easy stuff--like how to create and run simple PHP scripts that modify web pages-- and then build on what you've learned through a series of cohesive (and fun) exercises that carry over from lesson to lesson.    As the chapters progress you begin to build a web site for a growing used car dealership business. This approach keeps the material fun and challenging-- and gives what you've learned a context to be relevant. A car dealership needs a constantly changing web site because the inventory of cars is always changing. HTML is not the answer for this kind of web site-- but PHP and mySQL are!    Throughout the book you will be working with the web site for the car dealership and adding features and modifying it as the needs of the business (and your knowledge) grow. This writing style reinforces the previous lessons and keeps you engaged in a ""real"" project -- giving you both a sense of accomplishment and an opportunity to apply what you've learned to a realistic scenario. You are far more likely to retain what you've learned using this approach than just reading dry syntax documentation.    The author has an easy and fun style of writing that teaches you PHP in a simple, matter of fact manner while showing you the most common uses of the commands you need to get the job done. This keeps your learning pace quick and uncluttered. If you need it, he also points you to several resources where you can learn more about the other options a PHP function can offer and-- even better--how to read and understand those resources.    If you want to learn the PHP language in an easy, enjoyable, well laid out manner and to learn why PHP and mySQL are so powerful and fun to use then buy this book!! Do not buy this book if you are looking for a comprehensive reference of boring PHP syntax.    This book does not attempt to cover everything about PHP. What it does do-- and does well-- is take you from being a beginner who isn't even sure what PHP is to someone who knows the sheer joy that only programming dynamic sites can provide. You will become someone who can read, write, and modify PHP scripts and you will be able make your website come alive.    Bonus Code    All the source code referenced in the book is available for easy download and well organized. You don't have to cut and paste out of Kindle or retype code, unless you want to. There is even a video tutorial showing how to get started.    Topics Covered...    - Installing and configuring PHP  - Introduction to HTML  - Basic PHP Syntax  - Some Fun Right Away  - Editors and Staying Organized  - Variables, Numbers, Dates and Strings  - Control Structures  - How to use a database, such as mySQL  - Using PHP and mySQL Together  - How to create forms to Display, Add, Edit, and Delete data  - Session Variables  - Working with Images  - PHP File Uploads  - PHP Quirks and Tips  - Security Considerations    This book is NOT the only book you'll ever need to read to master PHP. The book is a gentle introduction to a very rich topic.

Although assembly language is commonly used for writing device drivers, emulators, and video games, many programmers find its somewhat unfriendly syntax intimidating to learn and use.</p> <p>Since 1996, Randall Hyde's <em>The Art of Assembly Language</em> has provided a comprehensive, plain-English, and patient introduction to assembly for non-assembly programmers. Hyde's primary teaching tool, High Level Assembler (or HLA), incorporates many of the features found in high-level languages (like C, C++, and Java) to help you quickly grasp basic assembly concepts. HLA lets you write true low-level code while enjoying the benefits of high-level language programming.</p> <p>As you read <em>The Art of Assembly Language</em>, you'll learn the low-level theory fundamental to computer science and turn that understanding into real, functional code. You'll learn how to:</p> <ul> <li>Edit, compile, and run an HLA program</li> <li>Declare and use constants, scalar variables, pointers, arrays, structures, unions, and namespaces</li> <li>Translate arithmetic expressions (integer and floating point)</li> <li>Convert high-level control structures</li> </ul> <p>This much anticipated second edition of <em>The Art of Assembly Language</em> has been updated to reflect recent changes to HLA and to support Linux, Mac OS X, and FreeBSD. Whether you're new to programming or you have experience with high-level languages, <em>The Art of Assembly Language, 2nd Edition</em> is your essential guide to learning this complex, low-level language.</p></div>

Pro ASP.NET Web API Security: Securing ASP.NET Web API (Expert's Voice in .NET)|Badrinarayanan Lakshmiraghavan|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51cT5K1f8pL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> ASP.NET Web API is a key part of ASP.NET MVC 4 and the platform of choice for building RESTful services that can be accessed by a wide range of devices. Everything from JavaScript libraries to RIA plugins, RFID readers to smart phones can consume your services using platform-agnostic HTTP.<p>With such wide accessibility, securing your code effectively needs to be a top priority. You will quickly find that the WCF security protocols you’re familiar with from .NET are less suitable than they once were in this new environment, proving themselves cumbersome and limited in terms of the standards they can work with.</p><p>Fortunately, ASP.NET Web API provides a simple, robust security solution of its own that fits neatly within the ASP.NET MVC programming model and secures your code without the need for SOAP, meaning that there is no limit to the range of devices that it can work with – if it can understand HTTP, then it can be secured by Web API. These SOAP-less security techniques are the focus of this book.</p></div>

It is the main programming language used to develop websites. It acts as a framework of sorts where different elements like color, video, images, flash animation, etc. could be added later on.    Back in the day, website creation and development would only go as far as one's imagination. Website developers of yesteryears had to get specialized education just to be able to learn a programming language and start developing websites, applications, etc. This was an extremely grueling process and would often times become the deterring factor for students. However, when HTML was introduced, website creation and develop got a whole lot easier.    This book will help you understand HTML's syntax and semantics, which will allow you to create a website completely from scratch. We'll teach you how to lay down the foundations—the backbone—of a website and then add aesthetic elements later on using Cascading Style Sheets or what’s commonly known as CSS.        <h2> Here’s  What You’ll Learn From This HTML &amp; CSS For Beginners Book: </h2>    ✓ Introduction  <b> ✓ HTML Fundamentals </b>  ✓ HTML Fundamentals 2   <b> ✓ HTML Fundamentals 3 </b>   ✓ CSS In-depth   <b> and much more </b>        <h2> What Are You Waiting For? </h2>  <h2> Start Coding HTML &amp; CSS Right Now! </h2></div>

Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook|James Elliott|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4148jFRw8iL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p>Do you enjoy writing software, except for the database code? <i>Hibernate:A Developer's Notebook</i> is for you.Database experts may enjoy fiddling with SQL, but you don't have to--the rest of the application is the fun part. And even database experts dread the tedious plumbing and typographical spaghetti needed to put their SQL into a Java program. <i>Hibernate: A Developers Notebook</i> shows you how to use Hibernate to automate persistence: you write natural Java objects and some simple configuration files, and Hibernate automates all the interaction between your objects and the database.  You don't even need to know the database is there, and you can change from one database to another simply by changing a few statements in a configuration file.<i>Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook</i> walks you through the ins and outs of using Hibernate, from installation and configuration, to complex associations and composite types. Two chapters explore ways to write sophisticated queries, which you can express either through a pure Java API, or with an SQL-inspired, but object-oriented, query language. Don't let that intimidate you though: one of the biggest surprises in working with Hibernate is that for many of the common real-world application scenarios, you don't need an explicit query at all.If you've needed to add a database backend to your application, don't put it off.  It's much more fun than it used to be, and <i>Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook</i> shows you why.Here's what a few reviewers had to say:""I'm sitting on an airplane after finishing <i>Hibernate: A Developer's Notebook</i>.  It's rare to find a book on a new Java technology that you can get through on a domestic flight.  That this notebook effectively and succinctly tackles object-relational mapping makes it, and Hibernate, even more impressive.  Many books in this category would need to be checked luggage.  With this book, you travel first class."" --Mike Clark""A simple persistence framework deserves a simple book, and this one delivers. The examples are well described and easy to understand, yet sophisticated enough to demonstrate Hibernate in a real-world context. Jim, I'm a new fan.""  --Bruce TateAbout the new Developer's Notebook Series from O'Reilly:Developer's Notebooks are a new book series covering important new tools for software developers.  Developer's Notebooks stress example over explanation and practice over theory. They are about learning by doing; by experimenting with tools and discovering what works.

Murach's JavaScript and jQuery|Zak Ruvalcaba|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51YcVzmD8TL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>There is a newer edition of this book titled <em>Murach's jQuery (2nd Edition)</em>.</p><p>JQuery is one of the technologies that every web developer should master. The trouble is that jQuery is difficult to learn, especially for programming novices. Now, this new book makes it easier than ever to learn jQuery, jQuery UI (User Interface), and jQuery Mobile. </p><p>In essence, sections 2 and 3 of this book present all of the jQuery and jQuery UI skills that you need for developing professional jQuery applications. With those skills, you'll be able to add all of the popular jQuery applications to your web pages: image swaps, image rollovers, collapsible panels, slide shows, accordions, tabs, carousels, and more. Beyond that, though, you'll have all the skills that you need for developing unique jQuery applications of your own.</p><p>But that's just two of the five sections in the book. Because you need to know JavaScript in order to use jQuery, section 1 presents the least you need to know about JavaScript to get the most from jQuery. This is essential for programming novices, but this is also valuable for experienced programmers who may not remember how a specific JavaScript statement or method works. In short, this section makes this book a complete reference for jQuery programmers.</p><p>In contrast, section 4 takes jQuery to a new level by showing you how to use Ajax and JSON to get data from a web server and add it to a web page without reloading the page. It also shows how to use Ajax and JSON with the APIs for popular web sites like Blogger, YouTube, Twitter, Flickr, and Google Maps. These are powerful skills for enhancing a web site.</p><p>To complete this package, section 5 presents a complete course in jQuery Mobile, which offers an exciting, new way to develop web sites for mobile devices. Today, the best web sites are available in both full and mobile versions, so this section also shows how to use a JavaScript plugin to redirect a mobile device from the full version of a web site to its mobile version.</p></div>

Serving as a tutorial as well as a handbook for experts, this is the book on C++ template metaprogramming.""<br>—Chuck Allison, Editor, <i>The C++ Source </i> </p> <p style=""margin: 0px;""> <b> <i>C++ Template Metaprogramming</i> </b> sheds light on the most powerful idioms of today's C++, at long last delivering practical metaprogramming tools and techniques into the hands of the everyday programmer. </p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">A metaprogram is a program that generates or manipulates program code. Ever since generic programming was introduced to C++, programmers have discovered myriad ""template tricks"" for manipulating programs as they are compiled, effectively eliminating the barrier between program and metaprogram. While excitement among C++ experts about these capabilities has reached the community at large, their practical application remains out of reach for most programmers. This book explains what metaprogramming is and how it is best used. It provides the foundation you'll need to use the template metaprogramming effectively in your own work.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">This book is aimed at any programmer who is comfortable with idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL). C++ power-users will gain a new insight into their existing work and a new fluency in the domain of metaprogramming. Intermediate-level programmers who have learned a few advanced template techniques will see where these tricks fit in the big picture and will gain the conceptual foundation to use them with discipline. Programmers who have caught the scent of metaprogramming, but for whom it is still mysterious, will finally gain a clear understanding of how, when, and why it works. All readers will leave with a new tool of unprecedented power at their disposal—the Boost Metaprogramming Library.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">The companion CD-ROM contains all Boost C++ libraries, including the Boost Metaprogramming Library and its reference documentation, along with all of the book's sample code and extensive supplementary material.</p> <p style=""margin: 0px;"">  <br>  </p> <div admonition-abrahams-and-gurtovy-have-written-something-close-to-a-classic-marvelous-fun-to-read="""" admonition=""""> <p style=""margin: 0px;""> </p> </div></div>"

Introduction to 64 Bit Assembly Programming for Linux and OS X: Third Edition - for Linux and OS X|Ray Seyfarth (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41Z-%2BVJe-QL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> This is the third edition of this assembly language programming textbook introducing programmers to 64 bit Intel assembly language. The primary addition to the third edition is the discussion of the new version of the free integrated development environment, ebe, designed by the author specifically to meet the needs of assembly language programmers. The new ebe is a C++ program using the Qt library to implement a GUI environment consisting of a source window, a data window, a register, a floating point register window, a backtrace window, a console window, a terminal window and a project window along with 2 educational tools called the ""toy box"" and the ""bit bucket"". The source window includes a full-featured text editor with convenient controls for assembling, linking and debugging a program. The project facility allows a program to be built from C source code files and assembly source files. Assembly is performed automatically using the yasm assembler and linking is performed with ld or gcc. Debugging operates by transparently sending commands into the gdb debugger while automatically displaying registers and variables after each debugging step. Additional information about ebe can be found at http://www.rayseyfarth.com. The second important addition is support for the OS X operating system.  Assembly language is similar enough between the two systems to cover in a single book.  The book discusses the differences between the systems. The book is intended as a first assembly language book for programmers experienced in high level programming in a language like C or C++. The assembly programming is performed using the yasm assembler automatically from the ebe IDE under the Linux operating system. The book primarily teaches how to write assembly code compatible with C programs. The reader will learn to call C functions from assembly language and to call assembly functions from C in addition to writing complete programs in assembly language. The gcc compiler is used internally to compile C programs.  The book starts early emphasizing using ebe to debug programs, along with teaching equivalent commands using gdb. Being able to single-step assembly programs is critical in learning assembly programming. Ebe makes this far easier than using gdb directly.  Highlights of the book include doing input/output programming using the Linux system calls and the C library, implementing data structures in assembly language and high performance assembly language programming.  Early chapters of the book rely on using the debugger to observe program behavior. After a chapter on functions, the user is prepared to use printf and scanf from the C library to perform I/O. The chapter on data structures covers singly linked lists, doubly linked circular lists, hash tables and binary trees. Test programs are presented for all these data structures. There is a chapter on optimization techniques and 3 chapters on specific optimizations. One chapter covers how to efficiently count the 1 bits in an array with the most efficient version using the recently-introduced popcnt instruction. Another chapter covers using SSE instructions to create an efficient implementation of the Sobel filtering algorithm. The final high performance programming chapter discusses computing correlation between data in 2 arrays. There is an AVX implementation which achieves 20.5 GFLOPs on a single core of a Core i7 CPU.  A companion web site, http://www.rayseyfarth.com, has a collection of PDF slides which instructors can use for in-class presentations and source code for sample programs.</div>"

Bicycle Design: An Illustrated History (MIT Press)|Hans-Erhard Lessing|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41USex5MrdL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <p>The bicycle ranks as one of the most enduring, most widely used vehicles in the world, with more than a billion produced during almost two hundred years of cycling history. This book offers an authoritative and comprehensive account of the bicycle's technical and historical evolution, from the earliest velocipedes (invented to fill the need for horseless transport during a shortage of oats) to modern racing bikes, mountain bikes, and recumbents. It traces the bicycle's development in terms of materials, ergonomics, and vehicle physics, as carried out by inventors, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers.</p><p>Written by two leading bicycle historians and generously illustrated with historic drawings, designs, and photographs,  <i>Bicycle Design</i> describes the key stages in the evolution of the bicycle, beginning with the counterintuitive idea of balancing on two wheels in line, through the development of tension-spoked wheels, indirect drives (employing levers, pulleys, chains, and chainwheels), and pneumatic tires. The authors examine the further development of the bicycle for such specific purposes as racing, portability, and all-terrain use; and they describe the evolution of bicycle components including seats, transmission, brakes, lights (at first candle-based), and carriers (racks, panniers, saddlebags, child seats, and sidecars). They consider not only commercially successful designs but also commercial failures that pointed the way to future technological developments. And they debunk some myths about bicycles -- for example, the mistaken but often-cited idea that Leonardo sketched a chain-drive bike in his notebooks.  Despite the bicycle's long history and mass appeal, its technological history has been neglected. This volume, with its engaging and wide-ranging coverage, fills that gap. It will be the starting point for all future histories of the bicycle.</p></div>

Large-Scale C++ Software Design|John Lakos (Author)|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512NBbDYaAL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> This is the definitive book for all C++ software professionals involved in large development efforts such as databases, operating systems, compilers, and frameworks. It is the first C++ book that actually demonstrates how to design large systems, and one of the few books on object-oriented design specifically geared to practical aspects of the C++ programming language. In this book, Lakos explains the process of decomposing large systems into physical (not inheritance) hierarchies of smaller, more manageable components. Such systems with their acyclic physical dependencies are fundamentally easier and more economical to maintain, test, and reuse than tightly interdependent systems. In addition to explaining the motivation for following good physical as well as logical design practices, Lakos provides you with a catalog of specific techniques designed to eliminate cyclic, compile-time, and link-time (physical) dependencies. He then extends these concepts from large to very large systems. The book concludes with a comprehensive top-down approach to the logical design of individual components. Appendices include a valuable design pattern Protocol Hierarchy designed to avoid fat inte</div>

Design Patterns in Ruby|Russ Olsen|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51kExzC-67L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <p>Praise for <b> <i>Design Patterns in Ruby</i> </b> </p> <p>""<b> <i>Design Patterns in Ruby</i> </b> documents smart ways to resolve many problems that Ruby developers commonly encounter. Russ Olsen has done a great job of selecting classic patterns and augmenting these with newer patterns that have special relevance for Ruby. He clearly explains each idea, making a wealth of experience available to Ruby developers for their own daily work.""</p> <p>—Steve Metsker, Managing Consultant with Dominion Digital, Inc.</p> <p>""This book provides a great demonstration of the key 'Gang of Four' design patterns without resorting to overly technical explanations. Written in a precise, yet almost informal style, this book covers enough ground that even those without prior exposure to design patterns will soon feel confident applying them using Ruby. Olsen has done a great job to make a book about a classically 'dry' subject into such an engaging and even occasionally humorous read.""</p> <p>—Peter Cooper</p> <p>""This book renewed my interest in understanding patterns after a decade of good intentions. Russ picked the most useful patterns for Ruby and introduced them in a straightforward and logical manner, going beyond the GoF's patterns. This book has improved my use of Ruby, and encouraged me to blow off the dust covering the GoF book.""</p> <p>—Mike Stok</p> <p>""<i> <b>Design Patterns in Ruby</b> </i> is a great way for programmers from statically typed objectoriented languages to learn how design patterns appear in a more dynamic, flexible language like Ruby.""</p> <p>—Rob Sanheim, Ruby Ninja, Relevance</p> <p>Most design pattern books are based on C++ and Java. But Ruby is different—and the language's unique qualities make design patterns easier to implement and use. In this book, Russ Olsen demonstrates how to combine Ruby's power and elegance with patterns, and write more sophisticated, effective software with far fewer lines of code.</p> <p>After reviewing the history, concepts, and goals of design patterns, Olsen offers a quick tour of the Ruby language—enough to allow any experienced software developer to immediately utilize patterns with Ruby. The book especially calls attention to Ruby features that simplify the use of patterns, including dynamic typing, code closures, and ""mixins"" for easier code reuse.</p> <p>Fourteen of the classic ""Gang of Four"" patterns are considered from the Ruby point of view, explaining what problems each pattern solves, discussing whether traditional implementations make sense in the Ruby environment, and introducing Ruby-specific improvements. You'll discover opportunities to implement patterns in just one or two lines of code, instead of the endlessly repeated boilerplate that conventional languages often require.</p> <p> <b> <i>Design Patterns in Ruby</i> </b> also identifies innovative new patterns that have emerged from the Ruby community. These include ways to create custom objects with metaprogramming, as well as the ambitious Rails-based ""Convention Over Configuration"" pattern, designed to help integrate entire applications and frameworks.</p> <p>Engaging, practical, and accessible, <i> <b>Design Patterns in Ruby</b> </i> will help you build better software while making your Ruby programming experience more rewarding.</p></div>"

Agile Metrics in Action: Measuring and Enhancing the Performance of Agile Teams|Christopher W. H. Davis|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZTuIj5V9L._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Project tracking systems, test and build tools, source control, continuous integration, and other built-in parts of the software development lifecycle generate a wealth of data that can be used to track and improve the quality and performance of products, processes, and teams. Although the iterative nature of Agile development is perfect for data-driven continuous improvement, the collection, analysis, and application of meaningful metrics often fades in favor of subjective measures that offer less insight into the real challenges of making better software.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal""><em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">Agile Metrics in Action: Measuring and enhancing the performance of Agile teams</em> is a practical book that shows how to take the data already being generated to make teams, processes, and products better. It points out which metrics to use to objectively measure performance and what data really counts, along with where to find it, how to get it, and how to analyze it. The book also shows how all team members can publish their own metrics through dashboards and radiators, taking charge of communicating performance and individual accountability. Along the way, it offers practical data analysis techniques, including a few emerging Big Data practices.</p> <p class=""MsoNormal"">Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle,

Single Page Web Applications: JavaScript end-to-end|Michael Mikowski|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KT4qErFaL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> <div><p><b>Summary</b> </p><p>In <i>Single Page Web Applications</i> you'll learn to build modern browser-based apps that take advantage of stronger client platforms and more predictable bandwidth. You'll learn the SPA design approach, and then start exploring new techniques like structured JavaScript and responsive design. And you'll learn how to capitalize on trends like server-side JavaScript and NoSQL data stores, as well as new frameworks that make JavaScript more manageable and testable as a first-class language. </p><p><b>About this Book</b> </p><p>If your website is a jumpy collection of linked pages, you are behind. Single page web applications are your next step: pushing UI rendering and business logic to the browser and communicating with the server only to synchronize data, they provide a smooth user experience, much like a native application. But, SPAs can be hard to develop, manage, and test. </p><p><i>Single Page Web Applications</i> shows how your team can easily design, test, maintain, and extend sophisticated SPAs using JavaScript end-to-end, without getting locked into a framework. Along the way, you'll develop advanced HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript skills, and use JavaScript as the language of the web server and the database. </p><p>This book assumes basic knowledge of web development. No experience with SPAs is required. </p><p>Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. </p><p><b>What's Inside</b></p><ul><li>Design, build, and test a full-stack SPA</li> <li>Best-in-class tools like jQuery, TaffyDB, Node.js, and MongoDB</li> <li>Real-time web with web sockets and Socket.IO</li> <li>Touch controls for tablets and smartphones</li> <li>Common SPA design mistakes</li></ul><p><b>About the Authors</b> </p><p>The authors are architects and engineering managers. <b>Michael Mikowski</b> has worked on many commercial SPAs and a platform that processes over 100 billion requests per year. <b>Josh Powell </b>has built some of the most heavily trafficked sites on the web. </p><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><ol><h5>PART 1: INTRODUCING SPAS</h5> <li>Our first single page application</li> <li>Reintroducing JavaScript</li> <h5>PART 2: SPA CLIENT</h5> <li>Develop the Shell</li> <li>Add feature modules</li> <li>Build the Model</li> <li>Finish the Model and Data modules</li> <h5>PART 3: THE SPA SERVER</h5> <li>The web server</li> <li>The server database</li> <li>Readying our SPA for production</li></ol></div></div>

The Language of SQL: How to Access Data in Relational Databases|Larry Rockoff|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41t57zHR%2BXL._SX218_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|"<div> Most SQL texts attempt to serve as an encyclopedic reference on SQL syntax - an approach that is counterproductive, since this information is readily available in online references published by the major database vendors. For SQL beginners, it's more important for a book to focus on general concepts and offer clear explanations and examples of what the various statements can accomplish. This is that beginner book. A number of features make The LANGUAGE OF SQL unique among introductory SQL books. First, you will not be required to download software or sit with a computer as you read the text. The intent of this book is to provide examples of SQL usage that can be understood simply by reading them. Second, topics are organized in an intuitive and logical sequence. SQL keywords are introduced one at a time, allowing you to build on your prior understanding as you encounter new words and concepts. Finally, this book covers the syntax of three widely used databases: Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, and Oracle, with special ""Database Differences"" boxes that will show you any differences in the syntax among those three databases, as well as instructions on how to obtain and install free versions of the databases.

This book reviews the relevant concepts of FP and reactive architectures and then methodically introduces this new approach to domain modeling. As you read, you'll learn where and how to apply it, even if your systems aren't purely reactive or functional.

Excel VBA: for Non-Programmers (Programming in Everyday Language) (Volume 1)|Maayan Poleg|https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51jAcNnQdyL._SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_.jpg|<div> Microsoft Excel has, over the years, become the greatest software in the field of electronic worksheets.  Its strength is that it meets the demands of huge numbers of users worldwide. Nonetheless - despite the advancement and expanding use of this software - there is ever-increasing demand from the end users; much of which can only be solved by VBA programming (Visual Basic for Applications).  Therefore, “Excel VBA – In Everyday Language” was written in order to provide a response to the growing demand for the advanced capabilities of Microsoft Excel.  This book was written:  • For the “non-programmers” among us who have to create the same reports in Microsoft Excel time and again, and would like to automate the process.  • For people who wish to develop forms, screens and “machines” for data management within their organization.  • For individuals who wish to turn Microsoft Excel into a powerful tool in their daily work.   During the writing process I tried to visualize Microsoft Excel software and the VB editor through the eyes of the end users; people who may not have programming background, but aspire to reap the utmost from the program.  For this reason the book, based on many years' of experience in programming and training, has been written in everyday language, using as few technical terms as possible, to make for easy reading.  My goal, when writing this book, was to convey the main principles of VBA language and allow beginners, taking their first steps, to learn without requiring individual training.  For this purpose there are files of exercises accompanying the book. These may be downloaded from this link.  The exercise files are in .xls format, allowing the end users to use either the “Ribbon Versions” (2007 and higher) or other older versions of Microsoft Excel.  This new edition has undergone extensive processing and addresses Microsoft Excel 2010/2013 users, along with explanations for anyone using the older versions (2003 and 2007). Therefore, wherever there is a significant difference between Excel 2010/2013 and the old versions, explanations are provided in full.   While reading the book and using the practice files, you will know to:  • Add the Developer Tap  • Change Excel's security, Including trusted locations  • Enter the VBE (Visual Basic Editor)  • Change the VBE structure  • Record an absolute macro  • Record a relative macro  • Improve your recorded macro  • Apply to ranges (Cells, ranges, columns, rows, sheets, offset)  • Use Variables  • Use the 'With' command  • Manipulate strings  • Calculate Date and Time  • Interact with the user (Msgbox and Inputbox)  • Use conditions (IF)  • Loop through data (Do loops, For loops)  • Create your own functions (UDF)  • Create an Event macro  • Handle Errors   You will also learn some cool tips and tricks, and get some useful codes</div>

Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition|Thomas H.

Each chapter is relatively self-contained and can be used as a unit of study. The algorithms are described in English and in a pseudocode designed to be readable by anyone who has done a little programming. The explanations have been kept elementary without sacrificing depth of coverage or mathematical rigor.<br> <br> The first edition became the standard reference for professionals and a widely used text in universities worldwide. The second edition features new chapters on the role of algorithms, probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms, and linear programming, as well as extensive revisions to virtually every section of the book. In a subtle but important change, loop invariants are introduced early and used throughout the text to prove algorithm correctness. Without changing the mathematical and analytic focus, the authors have moved much of the mathematical foundations material from Part I to an appendix and have included additional motivational material at the beginning.</div>
